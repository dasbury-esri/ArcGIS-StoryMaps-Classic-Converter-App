                                        "description": "<p style='outline: none;'><i>Bog soak lake, Shanley's Lough, on the western side of Clara Bog, with rushes and Birch woodland in the distance. Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Clara Bog, Co. Offaly 000572</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Clara Bog is situated approximately 2km south of Clara village, County Offaly. Much of the site is state-owned and designated a statutory Nature Reserve. To the east of the bog the transition into calcareous woodland, and to the north the transition to the esker ridge have been retained. Some excellent examples of esker grassland occur within the SAC to the north of the bog. Some peripheral reclaimed farmland is also included in the site, because management undertaken in these areas can have a profound effect upon the rest of the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Clara Bog has long been regarded as one of the most important lowland raised bogs in the country, being the largest remaining example of the True Midland Sub-type. The bog has been the subject of much ecological and hydrological research since the 1970s.</p><p style='outline: none;'>It has well-developed hummock and hollow complexes, and one of the few remaining soak systems. The bog vegetation at this site has been much-studied. Variations in the proportions of bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.), Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.) have been related to ecological features such as pools, soaks and ridges.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Rhynchosporion vegetation is widespread at this site but is best developed in the wettest areas of active raised bog. This vegetation occurs along pool edges and on flats underlain by deep, wet and quaking peat. Typical plant species which have been recorded from the habitat at the site include the bog mosses <i>S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), White Beak-sedge, Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and the nationally scarce Brown Beak-sedge.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The largest part of the uncut high bog surface is comprised of degraded raised bog. Although the areas of degraded raised bog have a relatively well-developed raised bog flora, they are affected by water loss, to varying degrees, and thus they tend to be associated with the more marginal, sloping areas of the high bog. Common vascular plant species of degraded raised bog areas include Heather, Bog Asphodel, Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Deergrass, Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and Carnation Sedge. Indicator species of midland raised bog habitat, such as Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>, are present even within areas of degraded bog, however their cover is generally low. The cover of Sphagnum is also low (typically &lt; 30%) due to low water levels and perhaps other factors such as burning.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Bog woodland on Clara Bog occurs in several small stands associated with flushes on the western side of the bog, the largest of which lies to the west of Shanley’s Lough. There is a good example of a wet birch (<i>Betula</i> sp.) woodland which has a diverse vegetation, and the most easterly flush has open water associated with it.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The transitions into calcareous woodland, to the east, and to the esker ridge, to the north, are contained within the site, and some excellent examples of esker grassland also occur. Some peripheral reclaimed farmland is also included in the site, because management undertaken in these areas can affect the hydrology of the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Several rare invertebrate species are associated with the soak on this bog, including the midge, <i>Lasiodiamesa sphagnicola</i> (Order Diptera), for which Clara Bog is its only known Irish site, a click beetle, <i>Ampedus pomorum</i> (Order Coleoptera), and another midge, <i>Parhelophilus consimilis</i> (Order Diptera). Marsh Fritillary (<i>Euphydryas aurinia</i>, Order Lepidoptera), a butterfly listed on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive, has been recorded from the site, but in its present condition the habitat is only marginally suitable for the species and any populations present are likely to be intermittent, small and short-lived. Natural and human-induced changes are likely to make the habitat less suitable in the future. The bog is also important at the only known Irish station for the rare moss <i>Tetraplodon angustatus</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Clara Bog supports breeding Merlin (1-2 pairs), a scarce species in Ireland and one that is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive. Red Grouse also breeds, along with other common bogland species such as Meadow Pipit and Skylark.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The bog was divided into a western (Clara West) and an eastern section (Clara East) by the construction of a road and installation of associated drainage in the late 18th century. Clara East has been damaged by the insertion of a further dense network of surface drains in 1983/84. However, extensive restoration work on this part of the bog has since been undertaken involving the blocking of drains. The last peat extraction, carried out on the southern and western sides of the bog ceased in 2012. The effects of peat cutting and drainage (associated with both peat cutting and agriculture) along the southern margin of the site has been shown to be having an impact on the western side of the bog and threatens the soak systems and surrounding ARB habitat (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project</b> (LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>This site is open to the public and includes visitor information signs and a boardwalk over the surface of the bog.

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Mongan Bog, Co. Offaly 000580</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Mongan Bog is a true midland raised bog of medium size situated immediately east of the monastic site of Clonmacnoise, Co. Offaly, and 12 km south of Athlone. It is situated in a well defined basin, surrounded on 95% of its perimeter by high ground on mineral soil.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Mongan Bog is a mostly intact and unusually wet raised bog with classic hummock and pool formations over a large proportion of the surface. The high bog is dominated by degraded raised bog. Although degraded through drainage, the vegetation is still typical of a raised bog flora with species such as Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Bog Asphodel and Carnation Sedge often being dominant in species-poor areas. Other frequent vascular plant species include Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Deersedge, Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and White Beak-sedge. Characteristic species of midland raised bogs such as Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) also occur, however their cover is low. The Sphagnum cover in degraded raised bog areas is generally low, typically covering less than 30% ground cover.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The presence of the moss <i>Pleurozium scheberi </i>and Carnation Sedge indicate an oceanic influence. The bog supports a rich lichen flora, including <i>Cladonia portentosa, C. arbuscula, C. tenuis, C. floerkeana </i>and<i> C. glauca</i>, due in part to the absence of burning over much of the site. Many of the lichens occur on old Heather.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The bog has several features of special zoological interest. In addition its lowest strata are thought to be among the oldest in Ireland. Scenically it is part of area landscape rich in intact natural features (callows, eskers, limestone pavement) which enhances its importance even more. The bog has been the subject of considerable scientific research since the 1970s (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project</b> (LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Raheenmore Bog, Co. Offaly 000582</u></p><p>The site is situated approximately 5 km north west of Daingean. This raised bog developed in a small basin in the catchment of two major river systems; the Brosna to the west and the Boyne to the east. The peat is very deep, being up to 15m in places. The underlying rock is Carboniferous limestone, with overlying gravely glacial till and lacustrine deposits above this.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Raheenmore Bog contains a large area of Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;in the central part of the bog which has a well developed hummock hollow topography. The active raised bog comprises mostly sub-central ecotope, with a small single area of central ecotope.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Raheenmore Bog contains a relatively large wet central core of active raised bog. The hummocks are often colonised by the bog mosses <i>S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. fuscum</i>. Pools are well-represented, and it is the pool edges and wet lawns that the Rhynchosporion habitat is best developed. These areas are typically dominated by the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. The associated vascular plant flora is species-poor, with Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), White Beak-sedge, Bog Asphodel, Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) being the main species. In places, lawns of <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i> have infilled the pools. Overall, the cover of Sphagnum moss on the bog is very good.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Degraded raised bog dominates the marginal areas of the uncut high bog where drainage effects are most pronounced. The vegetation of these degraded areas is still dominated by plant species typical of intact raised bog, though the vegetation tends to be less species-rich than in intact areas and the cover of Sphagnum is usually below&nbsp;25%. The typical dominant species in degraded areas include Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Bog Asphodel, Cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.), Deergrass, Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and Carnation Sedge.</p><p>The high bog is surrounded by a narrow margin of cutover bog that is no longer being cut. Some sections of old cutover have developed narrow strips of birch woodland. Much of the rest of the cutover comprises un-improved pasture and wet grassland. Mineral springs feeding the lagg zone have been reported from the western part of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Peripheral drains (up to 4m deep in places) almost completely surround the bog. This drainage has been shown to have had a serious effect on the bog. A network of old drains also occurs throughout the eastern part of the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) own much of the site and an extensive programme of drain blocking and other restoration works have been undertaken.

                                        "description": "<p style='outline: none;'><i>Appearance of bog woodland community with Birch on the high bog surface at All Saints Bog. Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>All Saints Bog and Esker, Co. Offaly 000566</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>All Saints Bog is located 8km north-northwest of Birr and 6km south of Banagher. The Rapemills River borders the northern edge. A gravel ridge runs to the south, south of which the Little Brosna River flows. Approximately half of the site is state-owned. To the south of the bog are the fragmented remains of an esker ridge, which may have an influence on the hydrology of the large flush occurring within the site. The esker is included in the SAC partly for this reason, but also for its own intrinsic value. The area south-east of Coneycarn pit is steeply sloping and unfertilised, and supports a good example (though small in area) of species-rich calcareous esker grassland.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The active raised bog is dominated by bog mosses, e.g. <i>S. cuspidatum</i> in pools, <i>S. magellanicum</i> forming carpets and <i>S. austinii</i> forming hummocks. Heather (<i>Calluna</i> <i>vulgaris</i>) occurs on the hummocks. Characteristic species of midland raised bogs, such as Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), also occur. In the wettest areas, Rhynchosporion vegetation is relatively well-developed and widespread. Frequent species include Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), Bog Asphodel, White Beak-sedge and Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>). The relatively rare Brown Beak-sedge has been noted from wet pools within the site. The presence of the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>, a western species, is notable.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Degraded raised bog dominates the drier areas of high bog surface within this site. The most frequent vascular plant species in the vegetation are Heather, Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Deergrass, Bog Asphodel and Carnation Sedge. The Sphagnum cover in degraded raised bog areas is generally low, typically lying within the range of 5 to 20% ground cover. The presence, and local abundance, of moss species indicative of disturbance or drying-out, such as <i>Campylopus paradoxus, C. introflexus </i>and<i> Leucobryum glaucum</i>, is noteworthy. Locally, the cover of the lichen <i>Cladonia portentosa</i> can be high. However, the lichen cover is generally low due to frequent burning episodes which have affected the site in the recent past.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site contains the largest stand of Downy Birch (<i>Betula</i> spp.) woodland growing on ARB in the country. In the centre of the bog there is an elongated flushed area which is wooded, and this is surrounded by an outer non-wooded area. The rare myxomycete fungus, <i>Badhamia lilacina</i>, has been recorded from the site.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The birch woodland supports an interesting invertebrate fauna, with two rare species being recorded.</p><p style='outline: none;'>An extensive area in the north-east corner of the bog, representing about 20% of the bog surface, has been cut industrially milled, with drains running into the eastern edge of the birch woodland. This appears to be leading to the bog drying out, as the surface is reported to be much drier than when first surveyed in the mid-1980s (Source: NPWS).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: The Living Bog LIFE 14.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Ardagullion Bog, Co. Longford 002341</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Ardaguillion Bog is located 5km north-east of Edgeworthstown, in Co. Longford. The SAC comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The SAC is bounded in the north-east by the local road running to Coolagherty.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This bog is the remnant north-eastern lobe of a much larger bog that is now cutover and afforested. There are areas of hummocks and pools in the centre of the high bog and the surface is wet and quaking. There is one flush in the centre of the high bog. There is a small area of coniferous forestry on a section of high bog and cutover in the south-west of the site. Cutover bog is found all around this high bog. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, consisting of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> <i>vaginatum</i>), White Beak-sedge, Bog Asphodel and Bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia). The bog mosses <i>Sphagnum papillosum, S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i> are common on the high bog, and <i>S. austinii</i> is found at the centre of the site. At the centre of the high bog there are frequent pools that all contain the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) is found in all the pools in the centre of the bog and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) is present in some. The inter-pool areas have a high bog moss cover. Many hummocks have good clumps of the lichens <i>Cladonia portentosa </i>and <i>C. uncialis</i>.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>On the south-west margins of the high bog there was some young Lodgepole Pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) which did not thrive and has been clearfelled (see below). There is one very wet flush in the centre of the high bog with Common Cottongrass (<i>E. angustifolium</i>), extensive lawns of the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> and some Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>). The cutover in the north-west, east and south-east is dominated by Purple Moor Grass, Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) and Common Cottongrass. There is some Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub in the east of the site and extensive Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) scrub in the south-east.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Current land uses within the SAC include forestry, peat-cutting, and agriculture. The forestry is found on a small section of high bog and adjoining cutover in the south-west of the SAC. Areas of cutover in the south and west of the SAC that were previously forested have only recently been clear-felled. Peat-cutting appears to have taken place in recent years (2012 aerial photography) along the north-western, eastern, and south-eastern margin of the bog. Two fields in the north of the SAC have been reclaimed for agriculture. Damaging activities associated with these land uses include drainage throughout the SAC and burning of the high bog. Burning on parts of the high bog is evident on aerial photography&nbsp; from 2012. All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the SAC, and pose a continuing threat to its viability&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project</b> (LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The&nbsp;Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project </b>(LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

The bog overlies Carboniferous limestone bedrock and has developed in a small topographical basin.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The most recent survey undertaken in 2003 describes the bog as being very wet and quaking in places with a good Sphagnum cover, but with few pools. The vegetation is described as uniform throughout the bog. There are few pools on this site but it has very good hummock and hollow complexes. There is a small flush in the north western part of the bog. The bog does not appear to have been burnt in over 20 years and has a good lichen flora as a result.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midlands Raised Bog including Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and the bog moss Sphagnum magellanicum.

The bog has a luxuriant cover of bog mosses including <i>Sphagnum fuscum, S. papillosum, S. austinii, S. capillifolium, S. subnitens </i>and<i> S. tenellum</i>. This is a highly diverse range of species and these are found in hummocks and lawns. The site has very good hummock/hollow complexes with the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum pulchrum, S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i> present. The bog supports a number of other moss species, including <i>Campylopus atrovirens, Hypnum jutlandicum, Aulacomnium palustre, Leucobryum glaucum </i>and<i> Pleurozium schreberi</i>, and the liverworts <i>Pleurozia purpurea, Calypogeia sphagnicola, Cladopodiella fluitans, </i>and<i> Odontoschisma sphagni</i>.

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Ballyduff/Clonfinane Bog, Co. Tipperary 000641</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Ballyduff/Clonfinane Bog is located in Co. Tipperary, and lies some 6km to the south-west of Birr (Co. Offaly). The two bogs are separated by a small area of cutover bog, with Clonfinane Bog on the west and Ballyduff Bog on the east. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Clonfinane Bog is a large, flat lowland raised bog largely bordered by drains and, except in the immediate vicinity of the drains, is wet and quaking. The bog consists of a southern and a northern lobe, with the southern being wetter and containing a well developed pool and hummock complex. The drier northern lobe has been drained and exploited for moss peat and is not included within the SAC boundary. At the western end of Clonfinane Bog there is a small Pinus sylvestris woodland. Some blocking of drains with peat dams has been carried out at Clonfinane Bog as part of a NPWS restoration project during the late 1990s. This project has been successful in halting the loss of Active raised bog (ARB) at the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Ballyduff Bog is a smaller, domed bog, with a ridge at the north-eastern end. The south-east margin is wettest, with quaking areas and flushes. Towards the centre of the bog there is a well developed pool and hummock system. A moss peat development has affected an area in the southern part of Ballyduff Bog. This area has been the subject of restoration works in the form of drain blocking undertaken by <b>NPWS</b> and is showing signs of recovery.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Active raised bog is found in the wet central areas of both Ballyduff and Clonfinane bogs. Here there are well developed pool and hummock systems, with excellent bog&nbsp;moss growth patterns. A range of vascular plants typical of midland raised bogs is found, including Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (Erica tetralix), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and White Beak-sedge. It is in the wet, active areas that Rhynchosporion vegetation is best represented. The extensive pool complexes (mostly linear in shape) contain the bog mosses <i>S, cuspidatum, S. auriculatum</i> and <i>S. papillosum</i>, along with White Beak-sedge, Great Sundew (<i>D. anglica</i>), Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and cottongrasses. Sphagnum-rich lawns also occur in these wet central areas and some of this corresponds to Rhynchosporion vegetation. The rare Brown Beak-sedge has been recorded at this site.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Both Ballyduff and Clonfinane bogs contain substantial areas of degraded raised bog and these areas are typically located along the edges of the high bog. In these areas the peat is driest and the vegetation tends to be dominated by Heather, Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>E. vaginatum</i>), Deergrass, the mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> and <i>Hypnum cupressiforme</i> and the lichen <i>Cladonia portentosa</i>. Along the northern margins of Clonfinane bog this dry edge vegetation is characterised by an abundance of Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) which suggests that the peat is locally shallow and subject to groundwater infiltration. In the wetter areas of degraded raised bog higher up on the high bog surface Bog Asphodel is particularly prominent, forming extensive flats in places. The south-east margin of Ballyduff is wet, with quaking areas and flushes marked by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) and Bulbous Rush (<i>J. bulbosus</i>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>An area of bog woodland occurs on the high bog at Clonfinane where it is associated with an area of rather shallow peat which overlies a mineral ridge. This woodland is dominated by Scots Pine (up to 10 m tall), with an understorey of Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>). The ground layer is dominated by Heather and Scots Pine seedlings and saplings, along with species such as Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Ivy (<i>Hedera helix</i>). This area of woodland is at the drier end of the bog woodland spectrum, pool areas are absent and Sphagnum species other than <i>S. capillifolium</i> are rare.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The nationally rare shrub Alder Buckthorn (<i>Frangula alnus</i>) grows in tall birch woodland along the northern margins of Clonfinane.</p><p style='outline: none;'>On both bog areas there are relatively high levels of pine regeneration on the surface, which suggests that the surface is drying out. Burning poses a significant threat to the bog surface and especially to the area of bog woodland due to its rather dry nature&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

There are areas on the high bog with apparently old pools which are now infilled with <i>Narthecium ossifragum</i> and algal pools are also found. The hummock and hollow topography typical of raised bogs is absent from this site. There are a number of stands of <i>Myrica gale</i> scattered over the bog.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The central flush on the high bog contains an area of bog woodland, with <i>Betula pubescens</i> of various age classes. <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i> is abundant here and the vegetation is lush in places, with many bog moss species occurring. Scarce species found here include <i>Rhynchospora fusca</i> and <i>Carex limosa</i>. The lichens on the bark and branches are of exceptional abundance and diversity. The treeless flush which surrounds the wooded area has an abundance of Sphagnum species, <i>Calluna vulgaris </i>and <i>Eriophorum</i> spp. Mosses other than Sphagnum found in the flushes include <i>Aulacomnium palustre, Hypnum jutlandicum</i> and <i>Breutelia chrysocoma</i>. An unusual feature of the flush is the occurrence of small specimens of <i>Osmunda regalis</i> scattered uniformly over the area.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The cutover areas surrounding the high bog are mostly dominated by <i>Calluna vulgaris, Molinia caerulea, Juncus effusus</i>, and <i>Ulex europaeus</i> and Betula pubescens scrub. An area of cutover bog at the north of the site is frequently flooded and is dominated by <i>Molinia caerulea </i>and <i>Schoenus nigricans.</i> A very small, but extremely species-rich, damp calcareous stony community is found at the north of the site where a gravel ridge disappears under the cutover bog. Here, <i>Schoenus nigricans, Antennaria dioica, Selaginella selaginoides</i> and many other species are found, including a diverse lichen flora. Other, more calcareous and drier grassland areas support species such as <i>Carlina vulgaris</i>, <i>Thymus praecox</i> and <i>Hieracium pilosella.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'>Current land use on the SAC consists of limited peat-cutting at the north-east and south-west of the SAC. There is a small area of commercial forestry at the east of the SAC. Some areas of cutover bog at the south have been reclaimed for agriculture. Damaging activities associated with these land uses include frequent burning. This recurrent burning is having a serious drying effect on the bog. Drainage, for the most part, is restricted to the cutover areas of the bog. These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i><br /></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Barroughter Bog, Co. Galway 000231</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Barroughter Bog is a relatively small raised bog, situated on the shores of Lough Derg in Co. Galway, a few kilometres east of Woodford, and bounded to the north by the Cappagh River. The bog has a good dome, which is slightly hollowed towards the eastern side. The north-eastern corner (cut off by an old drain and track) and a narrow area in the south-east are fairly dry due to drainage and burning. During the 1994 survey of the bog  good quality central vegetation complexes were noted. However, by 2005 these areas had degraded significantly and only a small area of Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;remained. The decline in ARB is likely due to the effects of intensive peat cutting around the high bog margins.  Known locally as Moannakeera, the bog has formed on the floodplain of Lough Derg and the Cappagh River.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The vegetation of the bog is characterised by an abundance of <i>Rhynchospora alba</i> and <i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>, along with <i>Carex panicea</i>. The wettest area occurs where the bog is widest. This area features shallow pools, with <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, and <i>Sphagnum</i> lawns with <i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>. Barroughter Bog is one of the more south-westerly raised bogs in Ireland and supports species which are typical of western bogs (e.g. <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> and Racomitrium lanuginosum) and midland bogs (e.g. <i>Andromeda polifolia</i> and <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Between the bog and the Cappagh River there is a species-rich fen, with abundant sedges, bryophytes and other typical species such as <i>Schoenus nigricans, Myrica gale</i>, and <i>Succisa pratensis</i>. Other habitats within the site include: old areas of cutaway, which are being colonised by <i>Betula pubescens, Calluna vulgaris </i>and <i>Ulex europaeus</i>; wet woodland, dominated by <i>Betula pubescens</i>; drainage ditches; and wet grassland. Notable flora on the raised bog includes large patches of the relatively rare moss, <i>Sphagnum pulchrum</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>A threat to the extent and quality of active raised bog on the site is the level of turf cutting that has occurred. Burning has caused some drying out of the bog surface. The area of outstanding habitat (i.e. the very wet, quaking area) in the centre of the bog could be extended if burning was prevented, especially towards the south-west.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Barroughter Bog is a raised bog of considerable conservation value although has been severely impacted by peat cutting in recent years. Its proximity to the shores of Lough Derg, with its succession from open water through extensive reed beds and marginal scrub, to raised bog, adds to its importance. It is also the only raised bog on the shores of Lough Derg&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Lorcan Scott.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Bellanagare Bog, Co. Roscommon 000592</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Bellanagare Bog is a large bog situated 6km north-north-east of Castlerea in Co. Roscommon. It is classified as a western, or intermediate, raised bog, because it shows features of both raised bog and blanket bog. The bog is underlain by muddy Carboniferous limestone with a low permeability. The sub-soil is predominantly of clayey limestone till. The bog lies in an upland area at the top of a surface catchment divide. The surface of the bog is undulating and the peat is concentrated on ridges, with flushes occurring in between. A number of streams, including the Frances River, rise within the site. The bog is traversed by several tracks. A large section of the SAC is in state ownership.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog at Bellanagare is predominantly comprises non-active raised bog habitat. Well-developed hummocks and several quaking areas occur in the Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;area of the high bog. Rhynchosporion vegetation is best developed in the areas of ARB where there is deep and quaking peat. The notable moss <i>Sphagnum pulchrum</i> has been recorded from such areas, and <i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>, a relatively scarce species in Ireland, has also been recorded from wet pools. <i>Carex limosa</i>, a species more usually found on blanket bogs, occurs in some pools.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Bellanagare Bog is also notable for the range of flush types found. These occur quite frequently and are usually located in depressions. Flush types on the site include an in-filling lake, an extensive <i>Molinia caerulea</i> flush with a high diversity of plant species, a large swallow-hole flush, and flushes associated with springs, rises, and streams. One flush is coincident with a bog burst. The site also includes much cutover bog, small areas of heath, scrub, wet grassland and several small conifer plantations.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The scarce butterfly, Marsh Fritillary, a species listed on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive, is found at this site. This species has most commonly been recorded in areas where its food plant Devil’s-bit Scabious (<i>Succisa pratensis</i>) occurs, such as in flushes, cutover bog and wet grassland.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The site provides habitat for a relatively large population of red grouse (<i>Lagopus lagopus</i>), a scarce and declining species in Ireland red-listed on the Birds of Conservation Concern in Ireland.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The bog is vulnerable to water loss through the extensive drain network in the northern half of the SAC, and from active peat cutting which occurs all around the SAC. The bog is also very vulnerable to burning as it is a relatively dry bog (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Katharine Duff.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Brown Bog, Co. Longford 002346</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Brown Bog is located 5 km north-west of Longford town. The bog comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The bog margins are mainly surrounded by scrub/woodland.</p><p>This bog is situated in a drumlin-filled valley and consists of a small raised bog characterised by a central wet depression with quaking mats of bog mosses and tear pools colonised by algae. Water flows through the pools and it is possible that there is a spring located in the bog centre. A flush area occurs in the north. Abandoned cutover is found around the northern, western, and north-eastern bog margins. Remnant old deciduous woodland occurs to the north-west.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site supports typical midland raised bog communities, which include Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Carnation Sedge, Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda</i><i> polifolia</i>) and occasional Cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos). The high bog supports extensive quaking carpets of bog mosses including <i>Sphagnum magellanicum, S. papillosum </i>and<i> S. capillifolium</i>. Pools occur frequently and support <i>Sphagnum auriculatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>). Bare pools and algal pools are also found. Hummocks of <i>Sphagnum austinii</i> and <i>S. fuscum</i> occur. The high&nbsp;bog is drier around the margins, where Heather and lichens (Cladonia spp.) dominate. Scattered Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) occurs in association with the northern flush, along with Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>). Quaking flats of Bog Asphodel and bog moss lawns dominate the inter-pool areas of the flush. One pool with obvious water flow supports Bog Pondweed (<i>Potamogeton polygonifolius</i>).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Old cutover surrounding the high bog is mainly colonised by <i>Ulex europaeus, Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris,</i> and <i>Molinia caerulea</i>. In the north-west, old deciduous woodland with <i>Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris, Sorbus aucuparia</i> and occasional the <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> is found.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There are few landuses associated with this bog. There are no high bog drains and only two sets of marginal drains are present in the cutover to the north-west. There has been no recent peat cutting reported from the site. A large area of cutover to the east of the bog has been afforested with <i>Picea sitchensis</i>. The majority of the bog has not been burnt for some time, although recent localised burning has taken place along the southern margin. Overall there has been little damage to this bog, with only small areas of cutover present. The high bog continues to occupy most of the original peat basin.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Brown Bog is a site of considerable conservation significance as it comprises a relatively little-damaged raised bog. Although the site is small it supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats including hummock/hollow complexes, pools, and a flush system with a surrounding tear pool complex&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Lorcan Scott.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Callow Bog, Co. Roscommon 000595</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>The SAC includes the raised bog, known as Callow Bog which is situated 7km northwest of Frenchpark, Co. Roscommon on the south-western shore of Lough Gara and is underlain by Carboniferous limestone. The site includes both areas of high bog and cutover. Overall the high bog is relatively flat with slight slopes north to Lough Gara. The River Lung flows near the north-western boundary of the site isolating one section of high bog to the north. There is a low-relief drumlin to the northwest of the bog. To the south, the raised bog is surrounded by agricultural land.<u><br /></u></p><p style='outline: none;'>The site has also been selected as an SAC for the scarce butterfly, marsh fritillary (<i>Euphydryas aurinia</i>) (listed on Annex II of the Habitats Directive). This species is mostly found in areas where its food plant, <i>Succisa pratensis</i>, occurs, such as in flushes, cutover bog and wet grassland.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Callow bog is composed of six separate sections of high bog. The main lobe has been cut away into a vague crescent shape. The Lung River and a bog road run along the north of this section, separating it from a high bog area to the north. A local access road runs along the western side of main lobe and separates it from a section of bog to the west while another local access road separates the main section from an area of bog to the south and two further bog areas to the east. The site is separated from the adjacent Tullaghanrock Bog (SAC 002354) by the Lung River to the west.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Active raised bog at this site is confined largely to a few small portions of the largest, most northerly lobe, though parts of the other lobes may also be active. The active areas are wet, with a range of bog mosses including <i>S. papillosum, S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. fuscum</i>. Well-developed hummocks appear to be rare. The main vascular plant species within the active areas are the cottongrassess <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i> and <i>E. vaginatum</i>, Bog Asphodel, Carnation Sedge and Deergrass. Cover of dwarf woody shrubs such as Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) is relatively low due to the recent high frequency of burning. Pool areas are frequent within the active areas, though most of them have little vegetation and appear to be tear pools of recent origin.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The majority of the high bog at this site is classified as degraded raised bog. Most of the degraded area is dominated by Bog Asphodel, which often occurs as extensive, species-poor flats or hollows. Along the driest face-bank areas the peat surface is generally hard with Heather being the dominant species. Throughout most of the damp, degraded, high bog surface species such as Carnation Sedge, cottongrasses and Deersedge are locally abundant. Woody dwarf shrubs have a low cover and are low-growing due to the effects of recent burning. Pool areas are frequent, however as noted above, most are poorly vegetated which suggests that they are tear pools which are relatively recent in origin. Lichen cover is good on the high bog where no recent burning has occurred, with the main species being<i> Cladonia portentosa</i>. At the north-west corner of the site, some Birch (<i>Betula</i> sp.), Gorse (<i>Ulex</i> <i>europaeus</i>) and Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) are encroaching onto the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Two flushes dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) occur, the larger one found in the centre of the main lobe and the smaller one a linear feature with swallow holes to the north-east. The main flush has good bog moss cover and also supports Cross-leaved Heath, Devil’s-bit Scabious (<i>Succisia pratensis</i>) and Tormentil (<i>Potentilla erecta</i>). The rare Red Data Book species Alder Buckthorn (<i>Frangula alnus</i>) has been recorded from this central flush area.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Past peat-cutting has occurred (continued until recently) along much of the bog margins, apart from the northeast where the presence of Lough Gara has curtailed access and the bog margins are relatively intact. Afforestation has occurred on the high bog to the north of the site. The site has been subject to regular burning. These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and that pose a continuing threat to its viability&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Galway, situated approximately 12km northeast of Mountbellew and 9km southeast of Glenamaddy. The site comprises a relatively large raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The northern and western margins of the site are bounded by the Shiven River, the eastern margin is bounded by a mineral ridge. A road runs parallel to the south eastern margin of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the western raised bog type, and consists of two domes separated by a broad ridge of mineral soil. Overall the northern dome appears to be quite dry with limited areas of wet hummock/hollows. The lower southern dome contains an area of quaking bog with hummocks and tear pools. A small flushed area showing small-scale hummock/hollow development is found on the northern dome, to the north and northwest of a forestry plantation on the high bog. To the east there is an extensive flush with areas of open water. Cutover bog occurs all around the margins of the high bog, apart from a semi-natural margin to the north by the Shiven River.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog has vegetation tconsists of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.) and&nbsp;Carnation Sedge. Bog mosses (Sphagnum spp.) form a spongy mat in places but due to damage from drying out and burning they are rarely present as carpets. Over large areas, especially in the south, lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) occur in abundance. Hummocks of the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum </i>occur in the centre of the site and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> is also present. The area of quaking bog has hummocks and hollows, and is characterised by hummocks formed of the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>and<i> S. capillifolium</i>, extensive lawns of <i>S. cuspidatum</i>, with Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and tear pools. There are Bog Asphodel-dominated hollows and the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i> occurs at the margins of the tear pools. This area of the site supports several rare species of bog moss, e.g. <i>S. fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i>.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>In the flushed areas low hummocks of <i>S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> occur, with Bog Asphodel lawns and abundant Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>). The large eastern flush consists of a depression with open water and <i>S. cuspidatum</i> around the margin. Other species present include Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>), Bogbean and cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium </i>and<i> E. vaginatum</i>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Current land use on the SAC consists of peat-cutting around the edge of the high bog. Recent peat cutting has been carried out to the south, east and north-west using mechanised methods. Damaging activities associated with this land uses include drainage and extensive and frequent burning of the high bog.

Photo: John Conaghan.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Carn Park Bog, Co. Westmeath 002336</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Carn Park Bog is situated 8km east of Athlone in Co. Westmeath. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The margins of the SAC are bounded by roads on the north, west, and southern margins. A significant area of the site was formerly conifer plantation, which has now mostly been felled (see below).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Carn Park Bog is a medium size raised bog and is an example of a basin bog. The bog is bisected, into unequal parts, by a mineral ridge stretching into the bog from the northeast. The bog has a complex shape, with a narrow strip to the north of the ridge and a larger roughly rectangular shaped section to the south of the mineral ridge. The remaining high bog is surrounded by cutover bog; turf cutting has been more extensive to the west and northwest of the site. The bog appears to be deep, as cut faces on the west and south were approximately 4-5m high. Cutting has ceased at the site in recent years.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the midlands raised bog type, in particular the expanse of high bog to the south and south-east.&nbsp;The vegetation consists of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) and the lichen <i>Cladonia portentosa</i>. Cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum </i>and<i> E. angustifolium</i>) replace Carnation Sedge as co-dominants in the southern and central areas. The surface is very wet with an undulating hummock/hollow micro-topography. Pools and some drains have become infilled on the high bog with bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. magellanicum </i>and<i> S. capillifolium</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) and Common Cottongrass (<i>E. angustifolium</i>). Bog mosses cover much of the surface, forming hummocks of <i>S. papillosum</i> and the rarer <i>S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. fuscum</i>.&nbsp;Heather, Hare's-tail Cottongrass (<i>E. vaginatum</i>), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) cover the hummocks. Carpets of bog moss (<i>S. capillifolium, S. magellanicum, </i>and<i> S. cuspidatum</i>) occur throughout the site.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The abundance of a nationally rare species of bog moss, <i>Sphagnum pulchrum</i>, is noteworthy. This moss frequently dominates wet channels on the high bog. <i>Huperzia selago</i> is also found on the bog. <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> is colonising the eastern part of the bog&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project</b> (LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>This site is managed as a <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/raised-bog-demonstration-sites-ireland.html' target='_blank'>Coillte LIFE demonstration site</a> and is open to the public and includes visitor information signs and a boardwalk over the surface of the bog.</u><br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Carrowbehy/Caher Bog, Co. Roscommon 000597</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>The SAC includes the raised bog, known as Carrowbehy/Caher Bog and an esker ridge that adjoins the northern boundary of the bog running in an east-west direction.<u><br /></u></p><p>Carrowbehy/Caher Bog is a large floodplain bog developed between low drumlin hills in the headwaters of the River Suck, close to Lough O'Flynn and 8km north-east of Ballyhaunis, Co. Roscommon. Unusually, the bog has partly enveloped a drumlin to the north. The site is a good example of a western raised bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The bog is composed of four main lobes. The bog is the most species-rich of the region with a long list of bog moss (Sphagnum) species occurring in a variety of situations. The main section of bog is intact and features a number of small in-filling lakes, flushes, and a series of swallow holes. Extensive quaking areas occur throughout the main section and large inter-connecting, steep-sided pools and good, active hummocks also occur. The bog surface is wet throughout, even towards the margin.</p><p style='outline: none;'>To the west of the main section, and separated by a small stream a smaller circular dome exists. To the north, an area of old cutover adjoins a drumlin and a well-developed bog moss community which resembles the original base-rich 'lagg' zone with a gradual transition to bog is found.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The uncut high bog at this site is remarkably intact and contains a central, active area. Here, good examples of hummocks occur and there are extensive quaking areas and large inter-connecting, steep-sided pools. It is within this wet area that Rhynchosporion vegetation is best represented. The associated flora is characteristically species-poor with typical plant species including the bog mosses <i>S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Bog-sedge (<i>Carex limosa</i>), White Beak-sedge, Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> <i>angustifolium</i>) and Lesser Bladderwort (<i>Utricularia minor</i>). The relatively rare Brown Beak-sedge has been noted from wet pools within the site. The active area features two small in-filling lakes with several bog mosses species, including <i>S. auriculatum var. auriculatum, S. recurvum var. mucronatum </i>and<i> S. recurvum var. tenue</i>, as well as Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) and Many-stalked Spike-rush (<i>Eleocharis multicaulis</i>), amongst others. The presence of <i>E. multicaulis</i>, a species typically found in pools within&nbsp;blanket bog areas, emphasises the westerly nature of the site. The very scarce leafy liverwort,<i> Cephaloziella elachista</i>, was recorded here in 1985.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>To the west of the main section, and separated by a small stream, a smaller circular dome exists. This area of bog appears to have been little burned and a well-developed lichen flora has developed. The hummocks contain the uncommon lichen <i>Cladonia rangiferina</i> and the bushy Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) has many epiphytic lichens, such as <i>Ramalina farinacea, Physcia tenella </i>and<i> Parmelia perlata</i>. Well-developed pools also occur here.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Peat cutting is no longer taking place on the site and had ceased by 2003. Old face banks occur around much of the high bog. Burning was reported as an impacting activity 1993, and again by in 2005. However there was no evidence of recent burning of the site during the period 2005-2012.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Carrowbehy/Caher Bog is a large and little-damaged, species-rich bog featuring extensive, well-developed hummock/pool systems, small in-filling lakes, a series of flushes and swallow holes, scarce species and, in places, semi-natural margins undisturbed by recent peat cutting&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project </b>(LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Google Street View.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Carrownagappul, Co. Galway 001242</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Carrownagappul Bog is a large western raised bog of the ridge river basin type situated about 3km north of Mountbellew, in east Co. Galway. The bog has an approximately triangular shape and is somewhat fragmented due to numerous bog roads, tracks, and drains that extend into the centre of the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is a large area of uncut high bog at this site, though much of this is classified as degraded raised bog largely because it is affected by peripheral drainage. The degraded surface is relatively species poor, with Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Bog Asphodel and Carnation Sedge tending to dominate. Other frequent vascular plants include Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Deergrass and Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>). The Sphagnum cover in degraded raised bog areas is generally low, typically covering less than 30% ground cover. In these drier bog conditions the main Sphagnum tends to be<i> S. capillifolium</i>, a species which is tolerant of drier conditions. The hypnoid moss<i> Hypnum cupressiforme</i> and the lichen <i>Cladonia portentosa</i> also tend to be more frequent in areas of degraded bog.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>There is still, however, a substantial area of active raised bog present at Carrownagappul, and it is notably wet with quaking areas. Here, the best examples of Rhynchosporion vegetation are found amongst the wet flats and numerous pools. This vegetation is typified by the aquatic moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, as well as <i>S. auriculatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), White Beak-sedge and Common Cottongrass (<i>E. angustifolium).</i></p><p style='outline: none;'>Peat cutting has been carried out extensively over a long period at the site, and there are substantial cutover areas around much of the high bog margin and alongside the bog roads. However, peat cutting has ceased at the site in recent years. The site has been subject to relatively frequent burning, with a significant area of the high bog showing evidence of a recent burn during a survey undertaken in 2012.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The bog contains a number of different kinds of flushes, including an excellent example of a wooded swallow-hole flush system. A small area of permanent open water in this area has an abundance of stoneworts&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project</b> (LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Katharine Duff.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Crosswood Bog, Co. Westmeath 002337</u><br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Crosswood Bog is situated approximately 5km east of Athlone, Co. Westmeath. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The northern boundary of the site is defined by the Dublin-Galway railway line. This bog has been classified as a basin bog and as a Midland type raised bog. The high bog is an irregularly shaped rectangle with the longest axis orientated in an east-west direction. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The bog surface is wet across much of the site, and supports a well-developed sequence of pools, hollows and hummocks, and a partly wooded flush. Cutover areas occur on all margins of the bog.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the Midlands Raised Bog type, consisting of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>. The northern and eastern parts of the bog are locally wet and occasionally quaking, and are characterised by flats with Bog Asphodel and occasional hummocks of <i>Sphagnum austinii</i>&nbsp;. There are well-developed pools with healthy populations of <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. Regenerating bog moss hummocks (<i>S. magellanicum</i>) and a good bog moss carpet (<i>S. capillifolium and S. papillosum</i>) can be observed to the north-west.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>A wooded flush is located in the centre of the bog and supports a thick carpet of mosses and liverworts, such as <i>Aulacomnium palustre, Polytrichum commune </i>and<i> Pleurozium schreberi</i>. Here also are found Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Heather, Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>), Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), pines (<i>Pinus</i> spp.) and Sessile Oak (<i>Quercus petraea</i>).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site is noteworthy for the presence of the rare bog moss <i>Sphagnum pulchrum</i> which is locally frequent in the pool system and the quaking flats to the east. Fir Clubmoss (<i>Huperzia selago</i>) is also found on the bog.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Current land use on the bog consists of peat-cutting around the edge of the high bog; it is more intensively cut on the western and southern margins. While the northern margin has surface drains that extend into the intact high bog, however it has been protected from development due to the proximity to the railway. <b>Coillte</b> forestry was found to the south of the site on areas of cutover bog but has been clear felled (see below). Some fields on old cutover are used for pasture and are presently undergoing further reclamation. Damaging activities associated with these land uses include drainage throughout the site (both old and recent) and extensive burning of the high bog. These are activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Crosswood Bog supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummock/hollow complexes, pools and wooded flushes (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project</b> (LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.<br /></p><p>This raised bog was originally part of a much larger area of bog that has now been cutover and reclaimed for forestry and agriculture. Hodgestown Bog is separated by a mineral ridge from Ballynafagh SAC (391) and together these are two of the bogs at the eastern extreme of the range of raised bogs in Ireland. Although Hodgestown bog has no pools there are hummocks throughout the high bog and there is also a small hummock/hollow complex. Cutover is found all around the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>). The bog moss <i>Sphagnum tenellum</i> is common on the bog as is White Beak-sedge. Hummocks of the bog moss <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>are also common but only one hummock of <i>S. austinii</i> was recorded. The bog moss <i>S. magellanicum</i> is also frequently seen on the bog, in hollows with <i>S. tenellum</i> or with <i>S. cuspidatum</i> in in-filling old drains. In areas of the bog where there are signs of disturbance and bare peat patches are found the moss <i>Campylopus introflexus</i>, Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Ling Heather and Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) tend to dominate. Much of the site was burnt in the 1970s but a subsequent survey reported that the bog was recovering well with active Sphagnum regeneration. There was a swallow hole in the east of the bog, with an associated soak area where the bog mosses <i>S. palustre </i>and<i> S. recurvum</i> were recorded, but this area has now been cutover. The high bog is surrounded by cutover much of which has been planted with coniferous forestry, especially in the south and east of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting and forestry. Active peat-cutting is taking place all around the margins of the high bog. Coniferous forestry has been planted on much of the cutover, except in the north of the site. However, except for a small area on the west of the site most of the forestry has been felled. Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog. All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Carbury Bog, Co. Kildare 001388</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Carbury Bog NHA is situated 4 km north of Carbury in County Kildare. Carbury Hill, which rises to 142 m, lies directly south of the bog. This site originally consisted of two lobes but much of the large north-west lobe is actively cutover and has been excluded from the site.</p><p>The site consists of four sections separated by the old Edenderry railway line and the Carbury- Broadford road. Overall the southern section is quite wet with good hummock/hollow development. There is some marginal scrub woodland along the margins of the small western section. A narrow strip of deciduous woodland cuts through the main section in line with the old railway.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog with Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.). Other species present include Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>). Overall the high bog is relatively wet with good bog moss (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) cover with hummocks of <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i> present. Although occasional, the scarce bog moss <i>Sphagnum austinii&nbsp;</i>is present. The Red Data Book species Round-leaved Wintergreen (<i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i>) has been recorded from the woodland area along the abandoned railway line. Deciduous woodland with Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) and Willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.) occurs around the western bog margins. The old cutaway is mainly dominated by scrub with Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>), Downy Birch and Willow.</p><p>Current landuse on the site consists of limited peat-cutting along the western margins. This activity has resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and poses a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Carbury Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising of raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland. This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats including some hummock/hollow complexes, scrub and marginal deciduous woodland which add to the diversity and scientific value of the site. The Red Data Book species, Round-leaved Wintergreen has been recorded on this site. This site is only one of a few remaining raised bog habitats in Co Kildare (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Derrinea Bog, Co. Roscommon 000604</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Derrinea Bog is a small (ca 56ha) raised bog site in Co. Roscommon. It is situated on the northern margin of Cloonagh Lough, just east of the Mayo/Roscommon border and approximately 10km north-west of Ballyhaunis. The River Anaderryboy emanating from Cloonagh Lough forms the eastern and northern boundary of the bog. The bog is an example of a western ridge river raised bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The uncut high bog dome at this site comprises areas of degraded&nbsp; and active raised bog. There is a central active raised bog area which features an extensive area of pools, quaking flats and well-developed hummocks. The pools are generally dominated by the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>, which is usually accompanied by <i>S. auriculatum</i>, White Beak-sedge, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Bog-sedge (<i>Carex limosa</i>). The site supports two large pools (15 to 25 m in diameter) and these are infilling with rafts of Rhynchosporion vegetation. Surrounding the pools, quaking flats have good bog moss cover, with the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i> and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) also present. The hummock-forming bog moss <i>S. austinii</i> is found around the pools. The scarce <i>Sphagnum recurvum var. tenue </i>has been recorded from the site. Other species which occur on the hummocks include Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>). Non-active raised bog occurs towards the drier margins of the high bog dome.</p><p style='outline: none;'>A small area of heath, developed over a till mound, occurs at the southern end of the bog and this adds to the ecological interest of the SAC. It has an almost complete cover of <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, with occasional <i>Quercus petraea</i>.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Peat cutting no longer takes place at Derrinea. A limited amount of Difco and hand-cutting was reported in 1995, and it was noted that the high bog on the northern and eastern sides has been somewhat protected from turf-cutting due to its boundary with the River Anaderryboy. The most extensive areas of cutover occur to the south and west of the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Whilst much of the high bog surface at this bog is partially degraded due to drainage and turf cutting, the ARB is still remarkably wet and of good quality. Derrinea Bog is an example of a western raised bog and although it is rather small, the quality of the habitats is generally good. A number of other raised bogs and calcareous lakes lie in close proximity to this bog and together they constitute one of the most important ecological areas in the east Mayo / Roscommon region (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project</b> (LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Katharine Duff.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Cloonchambers Bog, Co. Roscommon 000600</u></p><p>Cloonchambers Bog is a large, relatively intact, undulating bog which lies north of the Ballinlough to Castlerea road, and about 6km west of Castlerea town in Co. Roscommon. It consists of two elongated peat-filled basins, separated by a strip of grassy, fen vegetation, found where thinner peat merges with mineral soil.</p><p style='outline: none;'>At Cloonchambers Bog the four areas of active raised bog occur in only relatively small, wet parts of the high bog surface in the west, north and east. It is, however, well-developed and includes examples of Rhynchosporion vegetation. Small pool systems occur in the active areas and many are colonised by the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>, Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), White Beak-sedge, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Bog Asphodel. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the uncut high bog surface at Cloonchambers is classified as degraded raised bog. Due to the effects of peripheral drainage and burning, most of the degraded bog habitat is in a rather dry state and thus the vegetation is dominated by varying mixtures of either Carnation Sedge and/or Bog Asphodel. Other frequent vascular plant species include Heather (Calluna vulgaris), Cross-leaved Heath (Erica tetralix), Deergrass and the cottongrasses Eriophorum angustifolium and E. vaginatum.</p><p style='outline: none;'>In flushed areas, which occur in sloping parts with a rather shallow peat cover, species such as Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) are locally dominant. Sphagnum cover is typically low in degraded areas and rarely exceeds 30% cover. A feature of the degraded raised bog at this site is the numerous areas of erosion channels and gullies which occur as a result of the rather steep slopes on the surface of much of this bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>An unusual feature on Cloonchambers Bog is the woodland which has developed on dry, heathery ridges in the north-eastern section. Trees found here include Sessile Oak (Quercus petraea) and Rowan (<i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>). Honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera periclymenum</i>), Ivy (<i>Hedera helix</i>) and Cowberry (<i>Vaccinum vitis-idaea</i>) are also found here, the latter a species which is generally scarce in Ireland, usually associated with montane heath habitats in the west and north of Ireland.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Species occurring in the fen between the two peat basins include Greater Tussock-sedge (<i>Carex paniculata</i>), Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>), Purple Moor-grass and Bog-myrtle.</p><p style='outline: none;'>A large population of the scarce butterfly, Marsh Fritillary (<i>Euphydryas aurinia</i>), a species that is listed on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive, is found at the site. It occurs in association with its food plant, Devil’s-bit Scabious (<i>Succisa pratensis</i>), especially in areas of fen, cutover bog and wet grassland.<br /></p><p>The site includes an area of cutover bog, part of which is now improved grassland. The structure of much of the high bog is poor due to the prolonged effects of drainage, associated with recent and past peat cutting, and possibly also burning.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The presence of an extensive flushed fen area on the high bog surface is a very rare feature of Irish raised bogs and is thus of considerable ecological and eco-hydrological interest. The presence of a large population of Marsh Fritillary adds to the interest of the site&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

It is set in a peat basin which is almost completely surrounded by mineral soil.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The core area of Kilsallagh Bog contains raised bog habitat of outstanding quality, with a vigorous hummock and pool system grading into an extensive area of bog moss lawns (notably <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i>), which are actively growing. This central part is extremely quaking. This grades down on the north-east slope into an unusual wet community which is flushed, and consists of a mixture of tall Carnation Sedge, Cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp), with frequent large tufts of Deergrass. This vegetation has a 100% understorey of bog mosses. Rarer Sphagnum species such as <i>S. fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> are known from the site. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The pool areas, which are loci for Rhynchosporion development, support typical species such as White Beak-sedge, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), sundews and the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Degraded raised bog is the dominant habitat on the uncut high bog surface at this site. In general the vegetation is dominated by Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-tail&nbsp;Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Deergrass, Bog Asphodel and Carnation Sedge, and in many areas these species form species-poor vegetation types with one or two dominants. In parts of the high bog, Purple Moor Grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) is prominent which indicates a degree of lateral water movement, i.e. drainage.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>A portion of the high bog on this site (c. 10 ha) was previously afforested by <b>Coillte</b> with Lodgepole Pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) which has now been clearfelled (see below). Many of the trees were severely stunted due to the wet conditions and a relatively healthy, albeit somewhat modified, bog vegetation was present even while the trees occurred on the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>As well as forestry, past peat cutting and drainage, damage to the high bog area has occurred from burning.

Of the uncut high bog area, only a small proportion is thought to constitute active raised bog, with the remaining area dominated by degraded raised bog. The active bog, which is very wet, is found in an isolated portion of the bog, in the south-west. Although fire has damaged the area a little, there is a well-developed hummock/pool system and some large hummocks found as islands in the bog pools have escaped damage. Three separate areas of long, winding pools occur, the best being in the centre of the bog. The pool areas are loci for Rhynchosporion development and support typical species such as White Beak-sedge, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), sundews (<i>Drosera</i> spp.) and bog mosses, especially <i>S. cuspidatum</i>.

                                        "description": "<p style='outline: none;'><i>The lake in the centre of the high bog area at Lough Lurgeen Bog with fringing reed swamp vegetation. Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Lough Lurgeen Bog/ Glenamaddy Turlough, Co. Galway 000301</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>The Lough Lurgeen Bog / Glenamaddy Turlough SAC covers almost 1,200ha and is situated east of the town of Glenamaddy, Co. Galway. It consists of a large turlough, over 170ha in extent, and an expanse of over 1,000ha of typical, intact, western raised bog. A small lake also occurs on the high bog. Water from the bog feeds into the lake, which in turn is linked to the turlough, and thus the three habitats are in close association. This type of complex is unique in Ireland, and is unlikely to occur anywhere else in the world, and the whole system is therefore of high conservation value.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The southern and eastern parts of the SAC comprise expansive areas of high bog collectively known as Lough Lurgeen Bog. The bog is split into two sections, the larger bog to the east (Lough Lurgeen East) is separated from the smaller bog to the west (Lough Lurgeen West) by a river flowing into Glenamaddy Turlough.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The majority of the high bog is classified as non-active high bog habitat. The surface is rather flat and the morphology is similar to blanket bog in places. In common with most areas of non-active high bog in the country the <i>Sphagnum</i> cover is low, with typically less than 30% ground cover. In these drier bog conditions the main <i>Sphagnum</i> tends to be <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i>, which is tolerant of drier conditions. <i>Hypnum cupressiforme</i> and <i>Cladonia portentosa</i> also tend to have a higher cover in degraded areas. A large, peat-bottomed, oligotrophic lake occurs in the middle of the bog and this feature is unique in Ireland. A small area of alkaline fen occurs at the south end of the lake where a river exits.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Within the wet pool systems which occur throughout parts of the high bog, Rhynchosporion vegetation is well represented. This is typically dominated by the aquatic bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>. There are also a number of fairly extensive quaking lawns dominated by <i>Rhynchospora alba </i>some of which are associated with surface drainage features. Some of these sections, and also including flushes, correspond with ARB. There is a significant variation in the vegetation complexes and flush types throughout the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The lake (known as Lough Lurgeen) and stream lie in a linear northwest/southeast depression within Lough Lurgeen East surrounded by three peat ridges. Generally Lough Lurgeen East appears to be rather flat with only slight slopes. It does not have a dome-like topography. Lough Lurgeen West consists of three main lobes almost detached from each other by old cutaway and tracks. The river which is much wider than the stream on Lough Lurgeen East runs between the Lough Lurgeen East and West sections and joins up with the stream coming from Lough Lurgeen. Levelling sections from Bord na Móna show that this stream flows over till.</p><p>Eutrophication of the bog lake is suspected as a film is seen on the water surface and it is known that sewage from Glenamaddy is discharged into the adjoining turlough and may back up along this stream at times of high rainfall and water levels. There are extensive flood plains along this river and the flooding waters exert an influence on the bog edge vegetation.</p><p>To the south large areas of bog have been cut in the past. Recent peat cutting has been carried out in isolated small plots among abandoned plots and along the facebank edge at the mid-south, east and west of the large intact bog (Lough Lurgeen East).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Glenamaddy Turlough has extensive areas of uniform vegetation, containing large stands of peat grassland, <i>Carex nigra</i> and <i>Polygonum amphibium</i>. Three rivers flow into the turlough, the largest from Lough Lurgeen Bog, and a well-defined swallow hole occurs in the northwest corner. The rare <i>Viola persicifolia</i>, a protected plant species, has been recorded from the seasonally inundated turlough bed (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project</b> (LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Monivea Bog, Co. Galway 002352</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Monivea Bog is situated approximately 5 km north-east of Athenry, Co. Galway. To the east lies the Killaclogher River and to the north a large coniferous plantation. It is located in an area of karstic limestone. </p><p>This bog consists of two higher areas to the north and south, with a central depression associated with an extensive flush system. The dome of the bog features a pool/hummock complex including wet, quaking areas. There is also a lake and swallow holes located in the north-west flush and soak system. Cutover bog is found all around the margins of the high bog and is extensive on the north and eastern margins. Tracks have been reported on the high bog to allow access for peat-cutting. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog has vegetation typical of the western raised bog type. Overall, <i>Trichophorum germanicum</i> dominates the drier part of the high bog. In the pool/hummock complex on quaking bog, the cover of bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) reaches 75%. Some pools are algae-dominated, but healthier pools have <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> and bog mosses. Heather and lichens are also found on the hummocks. The bog features a large soak-system in the north-west which originates at the lake. The open water is colonised by <i>Carex rostrata, Menyanthes trifoliata, Juncus effusu</i>s and <i>Potentilla palustris</i>, associated with quaking bog moss lawns. To the south-east of the lake there is a pool surrounded by scraw (or floating) vegetation. This consists of a quaking mat of mosses with <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos, Molinia caerulea</i> and <i>Carex limosa</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Swallow holes are vegetated by willows (<i>Salix</i> spp.), <i>Betula pubescens, Dryopteris dilatata, Potentilla erecta, Lonicera periclymenum</i> and <i>Succisa pratensis</i>. A number of small flushes with <i>Molinia caerulea</i>, Myrica gale and bog mosses occur around the site. The cutover areas are sparsely vegetated in the north, east and south, and where vegetation occurs it is dominated by <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>. The tracks in and around the bog are lined mainly with <i>Ulex europaeus </i>and willows with some <i>Betula pubescens </i>and <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>. <i>Ulex europaeus</i> encroaches onto the high bog at the mid-west of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There has been extensive mechanical peat cutting to the north, east and south of the bog, and some hand-cutting in the south-west. In places the peat facebank reaches 3m in height, with associated cracking and slumping. Drains of varying depth are present on the high bog. Burning events have occurred on the bog in the past and in places the peat remains un-vegetated. These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability. Recent peat cutting has been reported from the site (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</b> (LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Galway 002350</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Curraghlehenagh Bog is part of a bog cluster situated approximately 6km north of Mountbellew in Co. Galway. The SAC comprises a raised bog with areas of high bog and cutover, and lies on a relatively low-lying plateau entirely within the upper reaches of the Shiven River. Mature coniferous forestry occurs on the high bog to the north. The bog is a western raised bog that has been classified geomorphologically as a basin bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This bog shows a typical raised bog topography with a central dome which slopes gently towards the margins. The high bog supports an extensive quaking area with many pools. Hummocks and pools are confined to the top of the dome and the rest consists of pools separated by lawns of bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.). Two bog bursts and associated tear pool complexes occur on the eastern side of the bog. A number of flushes occur at the western edge of the high bog. Habitat diversity is increased with the presence of a narrow strip of old mixed woodland on the north-eastern margin of the bog. A number of bare erosion channels occur in association with the bog burst to the east.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This is a typical example of Western Raised Bog and the vegetation consists of Carnation Sedge with Bog Asphodel hollows, and tussocks of Heather (<i>Calluna&nbsp;vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) and Deergrass. Other species present include the mosses <i>Campylopus atrovirens, Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpure</i>a. Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) are locally abundant. The high bog supports an extensive quaking area with linear pools and lawns with bog moss (<i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>) and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>). Lawns of bog mosses, including <i>Sphagnum magellanicum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>, occur between the pools. In general, hummock cover is low, with occasional large <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> tussocks.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia purpurea</i>) and Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) are found in association with flush areas to the west of the site along with scattered Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Flora associated with the main channel in the bog burst to the east includes Heather, Royal Fern (<i>Osmunda regalis</i>), Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Narrow Buckler-fern <i>Dryopteris carthusiana </i>and some orchid species. The epiphytic lichen flora is diverse, with <i>Coelocaulon aculeatum</i>, and <i>Usnea</i> spp. occurring on Heather, and <i>Cladonia cervicornis subsp. verticillata</i> on the bark of birch trees. The small area of mixed woodland to the north-east supports Downy Birch, Rowan (<i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>), oak (<i>Quercus</i> sp.) and Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>).&nbsp;<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Current land use on the bog consists of peat-cutting along the north and east margins. Afforestation previously occurred on the high bog to the north-west but this has now been clear felled as part of a <b>Coillte LIFE</b> project (see below). Damaging activities associated with this land use include drainage and burning. Fire damage has been recorded in the 1980s but the present abundance of bog mosses indicates significant recovery of the bog surface in these areas. These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the bog, and pose a continuing threat to its viability. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Curraghlehanagh Bog supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats including hummock/hollow complexes, pools and flushes, and regenerating cutover which add to the diversity and scientific value of the site (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project</b> (LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>) and as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</b> (LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Katharine Duff.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Shankill West Bog, Co. Galway&nbsp;000326 </u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Shankill West Bog is a small raised bog with unusual topography and a largely intact dome, situated about 7 km north-west of Mount Bellew Bridge, in Co. Galway. A large proportion of the central dome of this bog comprises good quality raised bog habitat, with a good pool-and-hummock system. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The wettest areas of bog, which contain actively growing raised bog habitat, occur in the central and south-eastern portions of the high bog dome, and these areas are surrounded by areas of drier, degraded raised bog vegetation. The active bog is characterised by large, often interconnecting, pools with a rich and healthy community of bog mosses, separated by low rises with Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and abundant bog moss carpets. It is in the wettest areas of the bog that the Rhynchosporion vegetation is best developed. The quaking lawns are dominated by <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> and support White Beaked-sedge, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Bog Asphodel. Many of the bog pools are colonised by species such as <i>Sphagnum auriculatum</i>, sundews and Bog-sedge (<i>Carex limosa</i>). A small flushed area, with mineral enriched water, occurs within the pool/hummock system, indicated by the presence of the moss <i>Aulacomnium palustre</i>, amongst others. An old, largely infilled drain carries surplus water from this area.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The degraded bog habitat is typically dominated by vascular plant species typical of raised bog such as Carnation Sedge, Deergrass, Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Heather, Bog Asphodel and Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>). In some of the wetter areas of degraded raised bogs there can be well-developed hummocks of rarer Sphagnum species such as <i>S. fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i>. Along the margins of the high bog dome a few rather dry flushes dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) occur.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Although there is no recent peat cutting reported from the bog, the edges of the high bog dome continue to experience slow drying-out due to the effects of past peat cutting. In the south-eastern corner of the site a network of drains on the high bog has resulted in damage to the hydrology of this corner of the bog. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Shankill West Bog is one of the best examples of a relatively small raised bog. It is of particular interest because of the presence of unusual topographical features (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Cloonmoylan Bog, Co. Galway 00248</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Cloonmoylan Bog is a very large expanse of level western raised bog, situated close to the western shore of Lough Derg, near Woodford in Co. Galway. The western side of the site can be accessed from the Portumna to Woodford road that runs alongside most of the western boundary.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This bog contains a large area of good quality, intact Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;habitat. The surface displays a typical, undulating pattern of pools, wet channels and low hummocks. A wide variety of bog mosses occur over the surface of the bog, forming hummocks and wet lawns, and colonising the pools. The low hummocks are typically colonised by scattered large bushes of <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, with abundant <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i> and <i>Andromeda polifolia</i>. Some larger hummocks support <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> and a range of mosses. In the very wet areas of ARB, Rhynchosporion vegetation is well-developed. These areas contain numerous wet pools and lawns which are typically dominated by the aquatic moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The western indicator species, <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> and <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> are present in small amounts in the wetter complexes. <i>Andromeda polifolia</i> occurs sparsely throughout the whole bog. <i>Sphagnum austinii </i>hummocks are frequent, forming large hummocks in places. <i>S. fuscum</i> is also present in small amounts.</p><p>At least half of the surface of the peat dome comprises non-active high bog habitat. These areas have significantly lower water levels than in adjoining ARB resulting in a more species-poor peatland flora and a much reduced cover of peat-forming Sphagnum mosses.</p><p style='outline: none;'>A large flush dominated by <i>Molinia caerulea</i> is a prominent feature in the northern half of this bog. The flush runs in an east to west direction and there is a distinct central drain (probably natural) in which water flow is evident. In parts of this flush area wet bog woodland occurs, dominated by <i>Betula pubescens</i>, with occasional <i>Salix aurita</i>. Underneath the canopy of Birch, common plant species include <i>Juncus effusus, Osmunda regalis</i>, the bog moss <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> and <i>Myrica gale</i>. These species are typical of bog woodland habitat in Ireland. </p><p>The bog has suffered repeated burning in the past and recent marginal peat cutting has been reported.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Cloonmoylan Bog is of high conservation value, due to the large area of good quality raised bog habitats present, notably ARB and bog woodland. Habitat diversity on this raised bog is good and the presence of scarce plant species adds to the sites importance&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Tipperary 000647</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Kilcarren-Firville Bog is situated approximately 2km east of the village of Carrigahorig in north Co. Tipperary. It is a lowland raised bog complex which extends about 4.5km from east to west and is bisected into two roughly similar sized sections by a road running north-south through the bog. Kilcarren Bog is located to the west and Firville Bog to the east.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site contains substantial areas of active raised bog, which are largely confined to the wetter, more central areas of high bog. The vegetation here is typical of midland raised bogs, with Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), Deergrass, Carnation Sedge, Bog Asphodel and bog mosses all being common. The active bog, and to a lesser extent the degraded areas, support occasional pool areas and quaking lawns dominated by Rhynchosporion vegetation. Typical species of the habitat are the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), White Beak-sedge, Common Cottongrass, and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>). The cover of <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> typically exceeds 50% in these areas.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The degraded raised bog tends to occur along the high bog margins where the peat has been subject to drying out.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The uncut high bog is surrounded by a large cutover area. <i>Betula pubescens</i> woodland is widespread in most cutover areas, and <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> is common in a few locations.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Peripheral areas at Kilcarren-Firville Bog have been extensively damaged by past peat cutting, drainage, and land reclamation. The structure of the high bog has been detrimentally affected by drainage effects over a long period of time through a lowering of the water table. Despite this, Kilcarren-Firville Bog is of high conservation importance (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Katharine Duff.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Redwood Bog, Co. Tipperary 002353</u></p><p>Redwood Bog is located 7km south west of Banagher, mainly in the townland of Redwood, Co. Tipperary. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The site is bounded by the Middle Shannon Callows Special Protection Area (SPA) to the north and the River Little Brosna SPA to the north-east.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This bog is classified as a midlands type raised bog and as a medium sized ridge river bog. The bog can be divided into two sections, a cutover and drained western side and the eastern side that contains intact high bog. The largest intact eastern portion of Redwood high bog has a complex heart shape with the broadest section to the north and narrowing towards the south. This heart-shaped section itself appears to consist of two basins, which are separated, to some extent, by a stream (or flush) running south to north), which is partially underground. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the Western Raised Bog type consisting of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>. There are some hummocks of the bog moss <i>Sphagnum austinii</i>. A few of the pools in the north-west of the site support Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>). West of this section there is an area of high bog with tear pools. In this area Sphagnum cover&nbsp;is high and there are small amounts of the bog mosses <i>S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i>. Hummocks of the moss <i>Leucobryum glaucum</i> are also found here. In the north-west of the site lichen cover is high with <i>Cladonia portentosa, C. uncialis </i>and<i> C. subcervicornis.</i>&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>In the west of the site Deergrass, White Beak-sedge and the moss <i>Campylopus introflexus</i> are common in an area that was previously burnt. In the hollows throughout much of the high bog Bog Asphodel dominates.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Both the northern and southern areas of flush contain Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) and Heather. The southern section of flush is dryer, with Devil’s-bit Scabious (<i>Succisa pratensis</i>) and Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) found there. The central section of flush is the wettest and there is a <i>S. cuspidatum</i>-dominated pool surrounded by Purple Moor-grass and Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>). Patches of Carnation Sedge have been recorded along the western edge of this flush. The cutover to the north and west of the high bog is colonised by mixed deciduous woodland that contains large amounts of Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Redwood Bog has developed on the margins of the River Shannon and Little Brosna floodplains. Greenland White-fronted Goose, a species that is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive and that frequents the adjacent SPAs, has been recorded on the bog. However, numbers of birds using the bog in recent years are not known.</p><p>There has been extensive peat-cutting in the western half of the bog. Some recent cutting has continued at the site. Damaging activities associated with this land use include drainage throughout the bog (both old and recent) and extensive burning of the high bog. There are many indications that this bog has been burnt on a regular basis. These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the bog, and that pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Redwood Bog supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummock/hollow complexes, pools and flushes. This bog has developed on the margins of a floodplain and is one of the few remaining floodplain bogs in the country. Part of the bog is already a state-owned nature reserve (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: John Conaghan.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Sharavogue Bog, Co. Offaly 000585</u></p><p>Sharavogue Bog is located about 8km south of Birr, Co. Offaly, in the Little Brosna Valley. It is situated between the River Little Brosna and an elevated ridge of Carboniferous limestone. The eastern edge is bounded by a disused railway embankment, and the western edge by the river. The bog is underlain by low permeability limestone and limestone till. Groundwater up-wells at the base of the ridge that occurs to the east of the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Sharavogue Bog is one of the few remaining raised bogs in Ireland situated on a floodplain. It has a well-developed dome of uncut peat which is long and narrow. There is only a relatively small area of Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;confined to the more central part of the dome.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Whilst the surface is generally quite dry, there are some small pools and lawns where Rhynchosporion vegetation is well represented.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Species such as Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i> and <i>E. vaginatum</i>), Deergrass, Bog Asphodel and White Beak-sedge are common over much of the bog surface. Some areas have well-developed hummocks of bog mosses (<i>S. capillifolium, S. magellanicum, S. papillosum, S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. fuscum</i>). Whilst the surface is generally quite dry, there are some small pools and lawns where Rhynchosporion vegetation is well represented. Here the dominant species are <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, White Beak-sedge, Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>). The rare Brown Beak-sedge also occurs. Rhynchosporion vegetation is also well-developed in extensive wet cut-aways which occur along the eastern margins of the high bog. Other plant species of the raised bog which are less common are Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Round-leaved Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Towards the margins of the bog dome, areas are often dominated by one or two species, including <i>Calluna vulgaris, Narthecium ossifragum, Eriophorum angustifolium</i>, and <i>Trichophorum germanicum</i>. The Sphagnum cover in degraded areas is generally low, with a cover of between 10 and 30% being typical.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Within the cutover zone along the eastern margins of the bog there is up-welling of base-rich water and these areas now support carr woodland and calcareous fen vegetation. Areas of wet lagg vegetation such as this are very rare in the country and the lagg system at Sharavogue is one of the best-developed in the country. On the western side the high bog grades through fringing woodland, to alluvial wet grassland by the Little Brosna River.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The structure of much of this raised bog is poor as a result of long-term drying out caused by peat cutting. In addition, drains were inserted in about 60% of the high bog dome in the early 1990s though these were subsequently dammed. The bog surface has also been damaged by burning (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project</b> (LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

                                        "description": "<p style='outline: none;'><i>View of the high bog area at Cangort Bog. Photo: Katharine Duff.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Cangort Bog, Cos Offaly/Tipperary 000890</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Cangort Bog NHA is located 1 km north of Shinrone in Co. Offaly and Co. Tipperary.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is partially bounded in the south by the local road between Shinrone and Ballingarry and in the east by a tributary of the Little Brosna River.</p><p>This raised bog was originally part of a larger area of bog that has now been cutover and reclaimed for forestry and agriculture.  Cangort Bog has hummocks throughout most of the high bog and in places the surface of the bog is wet and spongy.  There are pools on the high bog, but they are either tear pools or dominated by algae.  Cutover is found all around the high bog.  There is coniferous forestry on the cutover in the south of the site and deciduous woodland on cutover surrounds the remainder of the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>).  Bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) are found over much of the bog and hummocks of the rare bog moss species <i>Sphagnum austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. fuscum</i> have been recorded, as have the more common hummock forming bog mosses <i>S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i>.  The tops of hummocks are completely overgrown with lichens, in particular <i>Cladonia portentosa, C. tenuis, C. arbuscula </i>and<i> C. uncialis.</i>  Lichens are abundant on the bog and the fact that there are large areas of mature Ling Heather covered in epiphytic lichens suggests that the bog has not been burnt for a long time.  The surface of the bog is wet and spongy in places and there are occasional carpets of the bog moss <i>S. magellanicum</i> and tracts of Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>).  The prominence of mosses other than <i>Sphagnum</i>, such as the moss <i>Hypnum jutlandicum</i>, on this bog is one unusual feature of the vegetation recorded for this bog.  The pools found between the Sphagnum hummocks are mostly algal with only a small quantity of the aquatic bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> recorded in them.  Tear pools were recorded in the south-west of the site and <i>S.cuspidatum</i> is more common in these pools.  White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) and Bog Sedge (<i>Carex limosa</i>) were recorded in the vicinity of the tear pools.  Other species of note on the bog include Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), which is quite common in the north of the site, and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) which is common throughout the bog.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>There is a track running across the site which has been colonised by Gorse (<i>Ulex</i> sp.) scrub and Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>).  It has been observed that there is less bog moss on the eastern side of the track.  Overall the vegetation complexes on the bog were considered to be atypical and of interest for this reason.  The south and south-east of the cutover has been planted with coniferous forestry and disturbingly the forestry is spreading onto the high bog.  In the east of the site there is an area of mixed woodland with mature conifers inter-dispersed with Oak (Quercus sp.), Beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>) and Horse-chestnut (<i>Aesculus hipposcastanum</i>).  The rest of the cutover directly bordering the high bog is surrounded by semi-natural Birch woodland.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include forestry and agriculture.  Coniferous forestry was formerly planted on the cutover in the south and south-east of the site (see below).  The only significant area of agricultural fields is in the north of the site.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Cangort Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummocks (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work to clear a conifer plantation from the surface of the bog and block ditches has been undertaken by <b>Coillte LIFE</b>&nbsp;(see below) at the eastern end of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</b> (LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Tipperary 000937</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Scohaboy Bog NHA is a large raised bog situated 4 km south-east of  Borrisokane, in County Tipperary. The site comprises a relatively large raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover.  The site is bounded by agricultural land on all margins, apart from the north where coniferous plantation ccur.</p><p>The site comprises a large relatively flat raised bog with slopes associated with the nearby forestry.  Overall the high bog appears to be quite dry with limited areas of wet hummock/hollows.  A number of tear pools occur to the north and centre of the site.  Cutover bog occurs around much of the bog margins.  An area of coniferous plantation is present on the high bog to the north of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of Midland Raised Bog type, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.), abundant Bog Asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum) and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>).  Other more locally occurring plants include Bog Rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>).  Bog moss (Sphagnum spp.) cover is generally low with scattered tear pools in the north of the high bog which are beginning to infill with <i>Sphagnum papillosum, S. capillifolium</i> and <i>S. cuspidatum</i>.  However, the scarce bog moss (<i>S. austinii</i>) is present in patches.  These pools are quite large with Bog Bean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) in some.  In places in the north of the bog, lichen cover is high with abundant <i>Cladonia portentosa.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the cutaway is dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and scattered Gorse (Ulex europaeus) scrub.  There is some scattered Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) scrub in places and in the west there is a small area of flooded cutaway with Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>).  The southern cutaway has old peat banks remaining and is dominated by Ling Heather with dense Gorse.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The Irish Red Data Book species Bird Cherry (<i>Prunus padus</i>) has been recorded from the site (in the past). </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting along the northern margins, with some limited peat-cutting in the east. Past afforestation occurred on the high bog to the north of the site but has been clear felled (see below).  Damaging activities associated with this landuse include drainage and burning.  Recent drainage activities (late 90s) have been recorded to the south-west of the site.  Fire damage has been recorded in the 1980s and more recently in the west of the site and there is evidence of regular burning throughout the area.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Scohaboy Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats including some hummock/hollow complexes and cutover which add to the diversity and scientific value of the site.

Laois, approximately 4km north-east of Borris-in-Ossory. Land uses within the SAC include past and recent peat-cutting at the margins and past forestry on the old cutover.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Apart from marginal slopes associated with cutover areas Coolrain Bog is relatively flat. Although the bog has no permanent pools it has well-developed Sphagnum hummocks. There are four flushes with pines on the bog, three in the centre of the site and one to the north. These flushes may result from subsidence which directs surface water flow through certain areas of the high bog.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the Midland Raised Bog type, consisting of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) on the hummocks, with Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) often found in the hollows. Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>E. angustifolium</i>), Deergrass and Bog Asphodel are all prominent species. Sphagnum cover is good with <i>S. magellanicum, S. capillifolium, S. austinii, S. papillosum, S. tenellum </i>and<i> S. cuspidatum</i> all recorded at the site.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>There are four prominent Lodgepole Pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) flushes found on the high bog. Around the margins of the high bog the lichens <i>Cladonia portentosa </i>and<i> C. uncialis</i> are found in abundance.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The majority of the intact peat surface is fringed by abandoned cutover bog, colonised by grasses and Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) or by broadleaved woodland dominated by Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>East of the bog old cutover was previously planted with <i>Picea sitchensis </i>and <i>Pinus contorta</i>, some of which have naturally colonised the intact bog surface.&nbsp;<b>Coillte</b> owns approximately half of the high bog at Coolrain Bog and in 2004 they carried out a restoration project to clearfell this woodland (see below). The main restoration measures undertaken were the clear-felling and removal of the mature conifer crop around the high bog and drain blocking. Follow-up work included the control of natural regeneration of conifer seedlings and annual botanical monitoring of specific quadrats from 2005-2008&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Coolrain Bog has been subject to high levels of domestic turf cutting in the past (and has continued in recent years), primarily along the south-east and south-west regions. The forestry and peat-cutting are activities that have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site. There is no evidence of recent burning on the bog and it has recovered well from old burns.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project</b> (LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Laois 002333</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Knockacoller Bog is situated approximately 2km south-west of Castletown in Co. Laois. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. </p><p style='outline: none;'>At Knockacoller Bog, due to subsidence, the middle of the bog is dominated by a depression that is leading to localised re-wetting. The bog has well developed hummocks, with pools only found at its centre. Near the margins the high bog slopes significantly towards the cutover areas.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog. The site is characterised by Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and Deergrass-covered hummocks, with an abundance of Bog Asphodel in the hollows. Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i> have been recorded at the site. Within the wetter central area of the bog Sphagnum cover increases and there are some small <i>S. cuspidatum</i> pools. The hummock forming bog mosses <i>S. fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> have been recorded at the site. The moss <i>Campylopus introflexus</i> occurs frequently in the north-east part of the site and is indicative of disturbance. Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) is found growing on almost all the areas of cutover. In the north of the site&nbsp;regeneration of cutover is occurring with Heather-covered hummocks and pools containing the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> and Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Land uses on the site consist of past peat cutting (ceased in recent years) around the margin of the high bog. Significant drainage ditches have been dug through the cutover at the north-east area of the bog. All of these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site and pose a continuing threat to its viability. Also along the northern margin of the bog in the cutover the dumping of household refuse has been reported. Another potentially damaging operation is a large quarry to the north-east of the cutover which may affect the hydrology of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Knockacoller Bog supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummock/hollow complexes, pools and regenerating cutover. Knockacoller Bog, along with the adjacent Coolrain Bog, is important because it represents the extreme southern range of the true midland raised bog type and, unusually for a midland raised bog, occurs in an area underlain by sandstone (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Mount Hevey Bog, Cos. Meath/Westmeath 002342</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Mount Hevey Bog is situated approximately 4km north-east of Kinnegad. The Meath-Westmeath county boundary runs through the centre of the bog. The SAC comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The Dublin-Sligo railway runs through the northern part of the bog isolating two smaller northern lobes. The northern lobes are adjacent to the Royal Canal.</p><p>The SAC consists of a long, narrow bog separated into four sub-sections; the larger eastern section supports a wet quaking area with a hummock/hollows and pool complex. A similar hummock/hollow complex also occurs in the south-west lobe and the north-west lobe of the site. A former small lake that occurred on the west side of this site (Cloncrave Lough) has now in-filled. Forestry occurs on the most easterly section of the site. There is abandoned cutover bog all around the bog and particularly on the western section. There are some wet and actively regenerating areas of the cutover along the southern margins of the western lobe and along the railway.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the midlands raised bog type. The vegetation consists of <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i> and <i>E. vaginatum</i>), <i>Narthecium ossifragum, Rhynchospora alba </i>and the midland bog indicator species <i>Andromeda polifolia</i> and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>. The wet quaking area in the eastern section of the bog has pools that support the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, with <i>Rhynchospora alba, Eriophorum</i> species and <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> at the edges. The hummock/hollow complex supports a range of hummock-forming bog mosses, including S<i>phagnum austinii </i>and <i>S. fuscum</i>, as well as other species such as <i>S. capillifolium, S. magellanicum</i>, and <i>S. papillosum</i>. Other plants found in the hummock/hollow complexes are <i>Andromeda polifolia, Erica tetralix, Narthecium ossifragum</i>, and <i>Trichophorum germanicum</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The infilled lake is wet and quaking and the vegetation is dominated by <i>Molinia caerulea, Myrica gale</i>, and <i>Betula pubescens</i>, along with the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum palustre</i> and <i>S. papillosum</i>. The <i>Betula pubescens</i> trees appear to be between 20 and 30 years old. The edge of the former lake is clearly marked by robust plants of <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>. Some areas of old abandoned cutover on the site are very wet and regenerating well, with a good cover of bog mosses, including species such as <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. papillosum, S. capillifolium, S. denticulatum</i>, and <i>S. subnitens</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current land use on the bog consists of limited mechanised peat-cutting, mostly on the eastern edge of the high bog. There are areas of old peat cuttings all around the bog with some very old abandoned regenerating cutover along the edge of the railway. An area to the east of the bog was afforested but was recently clear felled as part of a <b>Coillte LIFE r</b>estoration project (see below). Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes. Damaging activities associated with these land uses include drainage throughout the site (both old and recent) and burning of the high bog. These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the bog, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Mount Hevey Bog supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummock/hollow complexes, pools, flushes and regenerating cutover, as well as a number of scarce plant species (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project</b> (LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

                                        "description": "<p style='outline: none;'><i>Bog pool and hummock complex on the high bog surface at Garriskil Bog. Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Garriskil Bog, Co. Westmeath 000679</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog lies 3 km west of Lough Derravaragh and 3km east of Rathowen in County Westmeath. It is bounded to the south-east and south-west by the rivers Inny and Riffey. It is considered an excellent example of a midland raised bog of the ridge river morphological type.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The bog contains a large, wet central core of Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;which comprises a relatively large of the remaining high bog. There is a well developed system of pools and hummocks within this area.&nbsp;The bog mosses <i>S. austinii, S. fuscum</i> and the moss <i>Leucobryum glaucum</i> are important components of the hummocks, which are frequently crowned by the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> and sometimes colonised by Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>). The numerous areas of inter-connecting pools are mostly dominated by Rhynchosporion vegetation which form floating rafts on the water surface. Typical plant species present include the bog mosses <i>S. cuspidatum</i> (generally dominant) and <i>S. auriculatum</i>, the liverwort <i>Cladopodiella fluitans</i>, White Beak-sedge, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), bladderworts (<i>Utricularia</i> spp.), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>). Brown Beak-sedge, a sedge species considered to be rare on a national basis, has been recorded recently from bog pools within the site. The areas between the pools support occasional wet and quaking lawns of White Beak-sedge, as well as Bog Asphodel.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The vegetation of the degraded raised bog tends to be dominated by Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass, Bog Asphodel, cottongrasses (<i>E. vaginatum </i>and<i> E. angustifolium</i>) and Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>). The distribution and relative abundance of these species varies with peat wetness. Sphagnum cover is generally less than 30%. In these drier uncut bog areas the cover of the lichen <i>Cladonia portentosa</i> can be locally high. Pool complexes are rare and where they do occur they tend to be dominated by shallow open water or algal mats. Small areas of Rhynchosporion vegetation also occur in the surrounding areas of degraded raised bog, however the habitat is, in general, not well developed in such areas. In a number of places there is regeneration of Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) and pines onto the bog surface. Often the pines are associated with small flushes dominated by species such as Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Soft rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>), Bramble (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i> agg.) and Heather.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Along the north-east margin of the high bog a narrow band of fen-grassland occurs.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Peat cutting has not been reported from the site since the 1990s. Nevertheless, old face banks and cutover drainage associated with cutting along the entire southern half of the site are likely to continue causing negative impacts on the high bog habitats. Past drainage of the bog associated with peat cutting has unfavourably impacted on the bog (by causing a lowering of the water table), although many of these drains have now been infilled and blocked. Arterial drainage of the River Inny (undertaken by the OPW in 1996 and initially during the 1950s) is likely to have impacted on the site and may continue to pose a threat to the hydrological integrity of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Burning in the past has caused damage, though there has been no severe fire events reported in recent years with no burning reported since 1997.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Notably, a large proportion of the uncut high bog comprises very wet ARB, which is unusual for raised bogs in the eastern half of the country. Because of its relatively good condition the site is considered to be one of the best remaining examples of a raised bog ecosystem in the eastern half of the country (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project</b> (LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

It is underlain by Lower Palaeozoic shales and consists of two small basins which have coalesced over a low drumlin ridge. There are few raised bogs in the north-east region and Killyconny Bog seems to be one of the best developed. Though some marginal drainage and cutting has taken place, the central part of the bog is relatively intact.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the bog is very wet and there are many areas of pool and hummock formation that conform with Active raised bog (ARB). While the surface of the bog is mostly homogeneous there are some higher areas with dense tussocks of <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>.&nbsp;The pools support the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, and a good growth of algae in summer. Wet areas about the pools support other Sphagnum mosses such as <i>S. magellanicum, </i>while<i> S. papillosum, S. fuscum, S. capillifolium </i>and<i> Hypnum cupressiforme</i> are important components of hummocks. A range of vascular plants typical of raised bogs are found, including cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium </i>and<i> E. vaginatum</i>), heathers (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i> and Erica tetralix), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>). Also occurring on the site is Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) which is found almost exclusively on raised bogs and which is rare in north-east Ireland.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There are also lines of water movement or flushes, shown by the occurrence of <i>Carex nigra</i> and <i>Juncus effusus</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>DRB is largely restricted to the margins of the high bog areas where drainage effects are most pronounced. The uncut high bog area is surrounded by extensive cutover.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog is surrounded to the north and west by cutover bog and to the south and west by a mosaic of commercial forestry, cutover bog, scrub and rough grassland. There has been significant restoration efforts carried out on the bog and in the surrounding cutover. A plantation has been clear felled and subsequent drain blocking undertaken as part of a <b>Coillte</b> <b>LIFE</b> project (see below). Some drain blocking has also been undertaken on the high bog. A barrier dam has also been installed around sections of the cutover bog and many cutover drains have been blocked. Initial signs are that the rewetting of the cutover has been successful in providing conditions suitable for the establishment of embryonic bog vegetation and poor fen (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project</b> (LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project</b> (LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

An important feature of these bogs is that in some areas the transition from high bog to open water is intact and not separated by cutover bog as is the case in the majority of other Irish raised bogs.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog habitat includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The high bog at Moneybeg consists of a single small dome with extensive cutover areas to the east and west. Overall the high bog is flat, with slopes associated with the southern margin. There is a wet area with a characteristic micro-topography of pools, hummocks, and hollows. The local road from Mount Nugent to Finnea runs through the bog and an isolated northern section adjoins the lake shore. There is also a large mineral mound adjoining the western extent of the high bog. The raised bog is surrounded by agricultural land, which in the east slopes steeply down to the cutover. There was conifer forestry to the south and south-west which has been recently clear felled as part of a <b>Coillte LIFE r</b>estoration project (see below).</p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog at Clareisland consists of a small, linear high bog extending along the shore of Lough Sheelin with only limited cutover areas to the east and west. There is an extensive wet area with frequent pools on the high bog and there is a slight slope towards the semi-natural lake margin. The local road described above runs by the southern margin of the high bog and there is conifer forestry on cutover south of the road. Recent peat cutting has been reported from Moneybeg and Clareisland Bog SAC.</p><p style='outline: none;'>These high bogs have vegetation typical of Midland Raised Bog type consisting of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), White Beak-sedge and bog mosses (Sphagnum spp.), with Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) also present. On Moneybeg Bog, the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. papillosum, S. tenellum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> are plentiful in the extensive wet area, with many large pools lined by bog mosses, including the rare <i>S. fuscum</i>. Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) is present in some pools, along with the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. A few of the pools are completely infilled with bog mosses and Common Cottongrass (<i>E. angustifolium</i>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The Moneybeg and Clareisland Bogs are of considerable conservation significance as it comprises two raised bogs with remnant semi-natural lake margins.

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Clooneen Bog, Co. Longford 002348</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Clooneen Bog lies approximately 3 km south-east of Roosky in Co. Longford on the east bank of the River Shannon, just north of Lough Forbes. The site comprises areas of high bog, including bog woodland, and cutover bog, and is bounded by a mineral ridge to the east and agricultural fields to the north. Although it would have originally adjoined the River Shannon to the west and Lough Forbes to the south, it is now separated from these by a road and enclosed agricultural grassland. </p><p style='outline: none;'>This site consists of a narrow bog dome, with cutover bog to the north, south and west. An interesting feature is the extensive area of bog woodland growing on a flush in the northern section of the bog. There is also a large inactive flush to the south-east associated with a marginal area which slopes relatively steeply towards an expanse of old cutover. Wet grassland in this area is subject to periodic flooding from Lough Forbes.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the Midland Raised Bog type, with Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Deergrass all occurring abundantly. Other species present include Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), White Beak-sedge and Bog Asphodel. In the narrow central region of the high bog there are small pools containing the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>). Bog mosses are plentiful between these pools, with <i>S.&nbsp;capillifolium, S. magellanicum </i>and<i> S. fuscum</i> noted. These pools are associated with a depression and become algal-filled tear pools towards the margins of the high bog.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The open bog woodland is dominated by lichen encrusted Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), with a field layer of Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) and ericaceous shrubs such as Heather, Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>), Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) and Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>). Mosses such as <i>Hylocomium splendens</i> and <i>Breutelia chrysocoma</i> are also abundant. Species such as <i>Sphagnum recurvum, S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. palustre</i> are less common. There are also several ferns present including Hard Fern (<i>Blechnum spicant</i>) and Broad Buckler-fern (<i>Dryopteris dilatata</i>).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The flush to the south-east is dominated by Purple Moor-grass and may be associated with an area that has subsided. There are occasional clumps of Bog-myrtle, with some small Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>) bushes encroaching. This latter species is an invasive, non-native species. Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) is associated with this flush, indicating some groundwater influence.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Current land use on the site consists of mechanised peat-cutting to the north-west and south-west of the high bog. Some areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agriculture to the south-east and there are small conifer plantations to the east. Damaging activities associated with these land uses include drainage and burning. These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site and pose a continuing threat to its viability. The bog is generally Sphagnum-poor due to burning, but regeneration is taking place.(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Lough Forbes Complex – Ballykenny and Fisherstown Bogs, Cos. Longford/Roscommon 001818</u></p><p>Lough Forbes Complex consists of a number of different habitats, centred on the lake formed by a broadening of the River Shannon. As well as the lake itself, there is also a series of raised bogs, callow grasslands and a variety of other aquatic and terrestrial habitats to the west of Newtown Forbes on the Longford/Roscommon border.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Two raised bogs, located on the south-eastern shore of Lough Forbes, are known as Ballykenny Bog (to the north) and Fisherstown Bog (to the south). The two bogs are separated by an area of callow grassland and the Camlin River.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Ballykenny Bog is located in county Longford, 6.5km north-east of Longford town. It lies approximately 2km to the north of Brown Bog (SAC 002346) and immediately north of Fisherstown Bog. Lough Forbes and the River Shannon forms the western edge of the bog, while the Camlin River runs to the south. Castle Forbes Estate borders the northern edge. Corlehan Wood that is a mixed woodland lies between Lough Forbes and the bog on the western edge.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The central core area of the bog is quite wet and spongy, with a good complement of bog mosses and well developed hummocks. Ballykenny Bog is unusual in that some of the margins are intact, a rare feature in the Irish midlands. Between the Camlin River and the bog, a complete transition from raised bog to callow grasslands can be seen.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Fisherstown Bog is a good example of a midland raised bog that occurs just south of Ballykenny Bog. The River Camlin runs to the north-east, east, and south of the bog. Between the Camlin River and the bog, a complete transition from raised bog to callow grasslands can be seen.</p><p style='outline: none;'>In the wetter areas of the bog surface, Rhynchosporion vegetation is sometimes found. Active raised bog with&nbsp;<i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> is frequent, along with Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), White Beak-sedge and Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>). The relatively rare Brown Beak-sedge has also been recorded.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Degraded raised bog is largely confined to the marginal areas of uncut high bog where drainage effects from adjoining turbary are most pronounced. The plant species composition of degraded raised bog is generally similar to that of active raised bog, however species typical of very wet bog conditions are either much reduced in abundance or absent. In general, the most frequent vascular species are Deergrass, Common Cottongrass, Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>E. vaginatum</i>), Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Bog Asphodel and Carnation Sedge. The most frequent lower plant species present are the lichen <i>Cladonia portentosa</i> and the mosses <i>Hypnum cupressiforme</i> and <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i>.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The transitional areas surrounding both Ballykenny and Fisherstown Bogs include a range of different habitat types (e.g. cutover bog, river, lake, scrub, woodland, callow grassland and former areas of commercial forestry which have been clearfelled). The total area of cutover bog is estimated to be circa 187ha.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bogs are vulnerable to water loss from peat-cutting and drainage, though ongoing restoration work involving blocking of drains is occurring (Source: NPWS).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland </b>(LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Corbo Bog, Co. Roscommon 002349</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Corbo Bog is located 7km west of Lanesborough in Co. Roscommon. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The site is bounded on the south by the Lanesborough to Roscommon road, and a road from this one to Kilroosky forms part of the western boundary. Corbo Bog is a midland raised bog that can be geomorphologically classified as a basin type raised bog. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The bog has been extensively cutaway all around the margins, and &nbsp;previously estimated that only 29.4% of the high bog remained since the 1840’s.</p><p>This bog is a remnant of a much larger bog that has now been mostly cutover. A long, relatively narrow section of the high bog remains. The high bog is shaped approximately like an inverted ‘L’, with the northwest corner comprising a section of relatively dry non-active raised bog, while peat forming habitat is present in parts of the remaining high bog area.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is an extensive pool-hummock system and overall moss cover is high. Much of the high bog surface, especially in the vicinity of the flushes, is very wet and quaking. There are five areas of flush found in the eastern side of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog has vegetation typical of a raised bog including Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>). Low hummocks of the bog moss Sphagnum papillosum are common, with small patches of <i>S. austinii</i> hummocks. In the centre of the site there are many inter-connecting pools containing Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>). The bog moss <i>S. magellanicum</i>, Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) and Common Cottongrass (<i>E. angustifolium</i>) are found around the edges&nbsp;of the pools. There are some hummocks of the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> found as islands in the pools in the north-east of the site. Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) has been recorded as occurring throughout the site. The relatively rare Brown Beak-sedge is found in areas of the high bog.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The five flushes in the site have similar vegetation and they are almost completely infilled with Hare’s-tail Cottongrass and the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. recurvum</i>. The large flush in the east of the site is dominated by extensive carpets of <i>S. cuspidatum</i>, with Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) occurring at the margins.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Active peat-cutting is carried out all around the high bog with the exception of the far western and southern edges of the site. Corbo Bog is a site of considerable conservation significance as it supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummock/hollow complexes, pools, and flushes&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

At least two small areas of woodland occur on the raised bog domes. However it would appear that this habitat is in the early stages of development. The largest area is dominated by low trees of <i>Betula pubescens</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>. Occasional trees of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> also occur. The ground layer is wet and quaking with a lush carpet of mosses present.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Hydrological modelling suggests that the largest part of the uncut high bog comprises Degraded raised bog (DRB). Recent peat cutting has been reported from Clooncraff and Cloonlarge Bog. A substantial proportion of the bog has been lost to peat cutting (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project</b> (LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank' style='outline: none;'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>) and as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</b> (LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Corliskea/Trien and Cloonfelliv Bog, Co. Roscommon 002110</u></p><p>Corliskea/Trien/Cloonfelliv Bog SAC, located approximately 5km south of Castlerea and straddling the Roscommon/Galway county border, comprises a complex of three raised bogs.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Among its most interesting features, the SAC contains large, wet, raised bog with well-developed pool and hummock systems, large diverse flush systems, subterranean streams with swallow-holes and a lake. At this SAC the uncut high bog comprises both Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;and non-active raised bog areas.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The ARB is largely confined to wetter, central areas. Here there are well-developed pool and hummock systems, in which hummocks are formed by bog mosses&nbsp;(e.g. <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. subnitens</i>) and are colonised by species such as Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass and Carnation Sedge. Rhynchosporion vegetation is best developed in the wet areas of the active bog. This is typically dominated by floating rafts of the aquatic bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>. Other frequent species of the habitat include <i>Sphagnum auriculatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), White Beak-sedge, Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) and Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>). The relatively rare plant species Brown Beak-sedge has been recorded from pool areas on the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The vegetation of non-active raised bog habitat is also composed of peatland species but is dominated by species indicative of drier conditions. The cover of <i>Sphagnum</i> moss is low due to the combined effects of drainage (mostly caused by peripheral peat-cutting) and repeated burning. </p><p style='outline: none;'>A remarkable feature of these bogs is the presence of well-developed, wooded flushes, some of which conform to the EU Habitats Directive priority habitat bog woodland.&nbsp;The canopy is generally of Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), and some areas have a shrub layer composed of Heather, Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) and Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>). The ground layer includes species such as Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and buckler-ferns (<i>Dryopteris carthusiana </i>and<i> D. dilatata</i>), and a characteristic feature is the presence of abundant bog mosses (including <i>Sphagnum recurvum var. mucronatum, S. squarrosum, S. fimbriatum </i>and<i> S. palustre</i>) which form thick carpets. The scarce species Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) is abundant here, creeping over the bog mosses.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>On Trien Bog the rare liverwort species <i>Cephaloziella elachista</i> has been recorded in this habitat. The rare shrub Alder Buckthorn (<i>Frangula alnus</i>), which is listed in the Irish Red Data Book, occurs at a swallow-hole flush on Corliskea Bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Non-wooded flushes also occur in the site. Some of these feature stands of Bog-myrtle with Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) and Purple Moor-grass.</p><p style='outline: none;'>A small lake occurs on the southern side of Corliskea Bog, which is colonised by <i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>. At several locations, series of swallow-holes occur along the courses of subterranean streams. </p><p style='outline: none;'>This site is of international ecological significance as a largely intact complex of raised bogs. Corliskea/Trien/Cloonfelliv Bog are excellent examples of this habitat, and shows a good diversity of microhabitats which are typical of raised bogs. The wooded flushes are of special significance, as bog woodland is extremely rare and the examples here are of high quality and support a number of scarce and rare species (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Ferbane Bog, Co. Offaly 000575</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Ferbane Bog is a relatively large, domed, midland raised bog located about 10km east of Shannonbridge in Co. Offaly. It is underlain by low permeability Waulsortian limestone and clay-rich tills. The bog is classed as a basin type bog being surrounded by on all sides by low relief bedrock ridges.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the surface of the bog corresponds with Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;and is wet and spongy and the cover of bog mosses and lichens is generally high.&nbsp;A wet, quaking area to the east occurs in a depression and is characterised by a dominant growth of Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), while another very wet quaking area on the western side of the site has well-developed inter-connecting pools. It is in these wettest portions of the high bog that Rhynchosporion vegetation is best developed. Here there are extensive lawns of <i>Sphagnum magellanicum </i>and<i> S. cuspidatum</i>, accompanied by vascular plant species such as White Beak-sedge, Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>). Lawns of <i>S. magellanicum</i> and hummocks of <i>S. papillosum, S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> occur in slightly drier areas surrounding these wettest zones. Carnation Sedge is present in abundance throughout the site, but particularly so on sloping areas. Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) occur in scattered patches throughout the bog. Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinum oxycoccos</i>) are also found. A flushed area occurs on the northern part of the site. Degraded raised bog occur towards the drier margins of the high bog dome.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The bog is surrounded by a narrow zone of cutover on all sites. Peat cutting has largely ceased at the site and only a single plot to the northwest of the high bog was reported as being cut during a survey in 2003.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There are numerous old drains present throughout the high bog, the majority of which remain functional and continue to have a significant impact on the high bog habitats.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The vegetation of the older cut away areas to the west, north and east of the bog is dominated by <i>Betula pubescens</i> and <i>Ulex europaeus,</i> with areas of <i>Pteridium aquilinum, Salix sp., Vaccinium myrtillus, Pinus sylvestris</i> and <i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Drainage is extensive at this SAC and has caused significant drying out. Past peat-cutting and some active peat-cutting have also speeded up water loss. However, although the high bog has suffered some water loss, it is still in restorable condition (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is being restored as part of <b>The Living Bog – Raised Bog Restoration Project</b> (LIFE14 NAT/IE/000032) underway at 12 bogs around Ireland between 2016-2020, thanks to EU LIFE Nature &amp; Biodiversity funding and further assistance from the Dept of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Further information: <a href='http://raisedbogs.ie' target='_blank'>The Living Bog</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Cloonshanville Bog, Co. Roscommon 000614</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Cloonshanville Bog is located approximately 2km east of Frenchpark in Co. Roscommon. The eastern boundary of the SAC is the Breedoge River, while the southern is the Frenchpark/Elphin road. The bog developed in a shallow basin in a groundwater discharge zone and is underlain by low-permeability, clayey limestones. The regional water table has been lowered, but evidence of groundwater inputs are seen on and around the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Cloonshanville has been classified as a western raised bog and geomorphlogically as a ridge river bog. The high bog is broadly rectangular in shape with a small extra lobe in the south-east, separated from the main lobe of the bog by a drain and a track. To the east the bog still lies close to its original boundary, the River Breedoge. An area of calcareous fen which occupies the site of a former lake adds to the overall ecological interest of the SAC as such fen areas are rarely encountered in association with raised bog systems.</p><p style='outline: none;'>At Cloonshanville Bog the majority of the uncut high bog is dominated by non-active raised bog habitats. However, a significant area of Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;occurs in the central and northern part of the bog. In the wettest areas hummock/pool systems have developed and it is here that Rhynchosporion vegetation is best represented. The pools and/or quaking lawns are dominated by the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> and White Beak-sedge. Other species which have been noted from this area include Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), Bog Asphodel and the bog mosses <i>S. papillosum </i>and<i> S. pulchrum</i>. Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) is a common species of the hummocks, occurring with such species as Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos), Bog-rosemary&nbsp;(<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and&nbsp;<i>S. fuscum</i>. The cover of lichens is generally good.</p><p style='outline: none;'>A large flush area occurs in the centre of the bog dome. The main body of the flush supports an extensive area of <i>Betula</i> dominated bog woodland. The woodland is well-developed structurally and contains a diverse range of plant species. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the degraded bog still retains a raised bog flora. <i>Sphagnum</i> cover is variable, but is generally below 30% within these degraded areas. The nationally rare <i>Sphagnum pulchrum </i>is common throughout areas of Degraded raised bog (DRB).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the uncut high bog has been impacted by drainage associated with past peat cutting around the edges and afforestation on the high bog. As part of a <b>Coillte</b> <b>LIFE</b> project the forestry on the high bog has been removed and drains blocked (see below). It is possible that dredging of the adjacent river may, indirectly, have had a deleterious effect on the hydrology of the habitat&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland Project (</b>LIFE04 NAT/IE/000121) undertaken at 14 bogs around Ireland between 2004-2008 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/index.html' target='_blank'>Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>This site is managed as a <a href='http://life04.raisedbogrestoration.ie/raised-bog-demonstration-sites-ireland.html' target='_blank'>Coillte LIFE demonstration site</a> and is open to the public and includes visitor information signs and a boardwalk over the surface of the bog.</u><br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

                                        "description": "<p style='outline: none;'><i>Looking eastwards over the marginal cutover and high bog at Flughany Bog. Photo: Google Street View.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Flughany Bog, Cos. Mayo/Sligo 000497</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Flughany Bog is an example of a western raised bog, located 10km south-east of Tobercurry. It is one of a series of small to medium-sized raised bogs which occur along the border between counties Mayo and Sligo. Flughany is comprised of two lobes which are separated by a ridge of mineral material. The bog displays some features of blanket bog morphology, such as the absence of a distinct dome.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Most of the wet, high quality Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;at this site occurs in the south-eastern portion of the uncut high bog area. Here there is a well-developed pool and hummock system. The numerous inter-connecting pool systems and wet flats support Rhynchosporion vegetation. Typically, the vegetation is dominated by <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, with White Beak-sedge, Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), bladderworts (<i>Utricularia</i> spp.) and <i>Sphagnum auriculatum</i> also present. Wet lawns dominated by White Beak-sedge also occur on flat ground between some of the pool complexes. Low hummocks of bog mosses, including scarce species such as <i>S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. fuscum</i>, are a feature of the bog surface.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Degraded raised bog dominates most of the high bog surface. The driest and most disturbed marginal areas of the uncut high bog surface are typically dominated by more ecologically robust species such as Carnation Sedge, Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass and Bog Asphodel, which tend to form extensive mono-dominant swards. Further into the high bog, where the water levels are higher and more stable, the vegetation is less disturbed and more species-rich, and there is a high Sphagnum cover (typically 25 to 50%). Pool areas are rare in areas of degraded raised bog and where they occur they tend to be shallow and dominated by an algal mat with little Sphagnum cover.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>At Flughany, the structure of the bog is partially damaged mainly due to the effects of peat extraction along the margins of the high bog area. This peat cutting, which has continued until recently, has lowered the water levels and has resulted in a species-poor flora, which has a low <i>Sphagnum</i> cover, over a substantial part of the surface.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Flughany Bog, whilst small, is a good example of a relatively intact raised bog. The site is also of note as it occurs close to the north-western limit of raised bog formation in Ireland. Overall, the site displays a good diversity of the flora and fauna that is typical of raised bog habitats (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

The site comprises three separate sub-sites which were once part of a more extensive bog complex, but which are now separated by cutover bog. Two of these sub-sites contain high bog, with associated cutover bog, and the third area is open water (Drumalough) at the eastern end of the SAC, surrounded by wet grassland and freshwater marsh. The two raised bogs in this SAC are examples of western raised bogs and are referred to as Drumalough East and Drumalough West.</p><p>The eastern section of high bog is distinctly domed and supports typical raised bog vegetation and microtopographical features such as hummocks, pools, and flats. The bog surface is very wet and, in places, quaking, and an extensive pool system occurs. An area of flushed vegetation exists at the north-western side, separating the wetter bog from a drier area. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The western section of high bog is drier, but also includes typical raised bog vegetation as well as a pool system in its eastern lobe, and there is a large pond in the southern end. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The two raised bogs in this site are examples of Western Raised Bogs, with species such as Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Carnation Sedge, the moss <i>Racomitrium languinosum</i>, the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> and lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.). Hare’s-tail&nbsp;Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> <i>vaginatum</i>), Deergrass and Bog Asphodel are also found here. The vegetation of the pool systems on both raised bog sites is dominated by the bog moss, <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Marsh Lousewort (<i>Pedicularis palustris</i>).

Mayo, though parts are located in west Sligo and north Roscommon.&nbsp;Within the River Moy SAC, the raised bog habitat for which the SAC has been selected occurs at five locations, namely Cloongoonagh Bog in the west and the bog cluster including Derrynabrock Bog, Tawnaghbeg Bog, Kilgarriff Bog, Gowlaun Bog in the east. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The bogs within the River Moy SAC are examples of raised bogs at the north-western edge of the spectrum and possess many of the species typical of such in Ireland, including an abundance of Narthecium ossifragum, Carex panicea, and the moss Campylopus atrovirens. Some of the bogs include significant areas of ARB habitat. Well developed pool and hummock systems with quaking mats of bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) occur. Several of the hummock-forming mosses (<i>Sphagnum fuscum</i> and <i>S. austinii</i>) which occur here are quite rare in this region and add to the scientific interest of the bogs within the overall site. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Depressions on the bogs, pool edges and erosion channels, where the vegetation is dominated by <i>Rhynchospora alba</i> comprise the habitat ‘Rhynchosporion vegetation’. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Non-active raised bog habitat is present where the hydrology of the uncut bogs has been affected by peat cutting and other land use activities in the surrounding area, such as afforestation and associated drainage, and also the Moy arterial drainage scheme. Species typical of the ARB habitat may still be present but the relative abundances differ. A typical example of the degraded habitat, where drying has occurred at the edge of the high bog, contains an abundance and more uniform cover of <i>Calluna vulgaris, Carex panicea, Trichophorum germanicum</i> and sometimes <i>Myrica gale</i>. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Occurring in association with the uncut high bog are areas of wet regenerating cutover bog with species such as <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>, bog mosses and sundew, while on the drier areas, the vegetation is mostly dominated by <i>Molinia caerulea</i>. Natural regeneration with peat-forming capability will be possible over time with some restorative measures (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

The Galway to Headford road runs by the east of the present extent of the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>At Addergoole a substantial soak system occurs, this area includes <i>Betula pubescens</i> bog woodland, active flush and bog lakes. The open water in this area is infilling with large rafts of Rhynchosporion vegetation. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Addergoole Bog is an example of a western broad floodplain raised bog, characterised by the occurrence of western species.&nbsp;Western raised bog indicators, including <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i> and <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>, occur throughout the active raised bog areas (ARB). Species indicative of flushed conditions, such as <i>Myrica gale, Molinia caerulea, Aulacomnium palustre </i>and<i> Empetrum nigrum</i> are more frequent throughout ARB, especially in the northern half of the bog, than is typical for raised bogs. ARB areas are characterised by high (51-75%) cover of Sphagnum with 11 to 25% cover of interconnected <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. denticulatum</i> pools. Lawns of <i>S. papillosum, S. magellanicum, </i>and<i> S. cuspidatum</i> extend from pools. Low and high hummocks of <i>S. capillifolium, S. austinii, S. fuscum </i>and<i> Leucobryum glaucum</i> were present. In addition very wet lawns of Sphagnum (cover circa 85%), mainly <i>S. papillosum </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i>, with frequent low hummocks of <i>S. capillifolium, S. austinii, Aulacomnium palustre</i> and occasionally <i>S. fuscum</i> are also present.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The active central flush or soak that bisects the bog is extremely wet. It is in effect a large S<i>phagnum cuspidatum</i> dominated pool with abundant islands composed of <i>Aulacomnium palustre</i> topped by <i>Calluna vulgaris, Molinia caerulea, </i>and<i> Juncus effusus</i>. <i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i> is locally abundant.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The active part of the central flush contains two pool systems. The southern pool system consists of two areas of open water with some emergent <i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>. These are bounded by stands of <i>Molinia caerulea</i> and occasional <i>Juncus effusus</i> that graded into floating mats of <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> with some <i>S. fallax </i>and<i> S. palustre</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The pool at the north-east end of the flush consists of open water and a floating <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>mat with occasional tussocks of <i>Molinia caerulea</i>. Away from the pools, the transition from inactive to active flush comprises a seasonally flooded area with frequent pools containing<i> Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. palustre</i>. <i>Aulacomnium palustre</i> hummocks are frequent at the edges of the pools with tall <i>Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum</i>, and <i>Myrica gale</i> abundant between pools.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Hydrological modelling suggests that the largest part of the uncut high bog comprises Degraded raised bog (DRB).

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Moanveanlagh Bog, Co. Kerry 002351</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Moanveanlagh Bog is situated in Co. Kerry approximately 6km east of Listowel. The SAC comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This is a relatively flat bog with some marginal areas that slope relatively steeply towards the cutover. There are a few large hummocks but over much of the bog the microtopography is very uniform.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog. The vegetation of the high bog is dominated by Bog Asphodel, White Beak-sedge, Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and Carnation Sedge. Small patches of the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> and Common Lousewort (<i>Pedicularis sylvatica</i>) occur at the site. Purple Moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) is very common in the flush areas. The tear pools are mostly bare of vegetation but some support bladderwort (<i>Utricularia</i> sp.) and the bog mosses <i>S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>, with <i>S. papillosum</i> and the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i> occurring at the pool edges. Towards the margins of the bog Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) is frequent.</p><p style='outline: none;'>A flush area extends along the north and north-east of the bog. In the south-west a bog burst has occurred and concentrically arranged tear pools can be seen, some of which are up to 12m long. A swallow hole occurs near to the middle of the bog. Cutover bog occurs around the south-west, south, and south-eastern margins of the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current land uses on the bog consist of a small area of peat-cutting at the margins and a low level of grazing by cattle in the north-east section of the high bog. Peat-cutting has significantly declined since the 1970s. Other damaging operations include extensive fire damage, which is still occurring, and the dumping of household refuse and cars around the high bog. These are all activities that have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability. This bog also suffers from invasive species, with the shrub <i>Rhododendron ponticum</i> recorded on the western edge of the bog and the carnivorous North American Pitcher plant (<i>Sarracenia purpurea</i>) forming a large colony on the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Moanveanlagh Bog is significant in terms of its geographical location as it is at the extreme south-western range of raised bogs in Ireland. This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including flushes (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Tullaher Lough and Bog, Co. Clare 002343</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Tullaher Lough and Monmore Bog is located 4km south-east of Doonbeg in Co. Clare. This is a diverse site comprising of raised bog (including areas of high bog and cutover bog), wet grassland, improved grassland, scrub woodland, alkaline fen, and lake. It is bounded to the east by the Doonbeg to Moyasta road, to the west by a local road, to the north by bog tracks and to the south by a conifer plantation.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog habitat at this SAC consists of a small dome of high bog with extensive cutover areas to the west and south. The high bog is flat, with slopes to the south-west associated with marginal drainage. There are wet hollows and a large pool with quaking margins at the centre of the high bog. There are also a number of small flushes.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog has vegetation typical of a raised bog, consisting of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolum</i>) and Bog Asphodel, with occasional Lousewort (<i>Pedicularis sylvatica</i>) a species typical of western raised bogs.&nbsp;Bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) are abundant, with 95% moss cover. Extensive lawns of <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i> occur, with occasional <i>S. magellanicum</i>. <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i> occur in wet hollows. The large pool in the centre of the high bog probably has mineral input as indicated by the presence White Water-lily (Nymphaea alba), Bottle Sedge (<i>Carex rostrata</i>) and Water Avens (<i>Geum rivale</i>). A dense quaking carpet of bog moss (<i>S. cuspidatum</i>) occurs at the pool margin. Heather, Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxyocco</i>s) and Common Cottongrass are also present. The flushes are dominated by Purple Moor-grass, Heather and Bog -myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).&nbsp;<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The extensive cutover consists of numerous old peat cuttings with turf banks and hollows. A mineral ridge with improved grassland adjoins the high bog to the north-west and there is semi-improved wet grassland to the north-east. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The vegetation of the low-lying areas beside the open water bodies of Tullaher Lough is dominated by <i>Phragmites australis</i>. Extensive quaking <i>Sphagnum</i> lawns with low hummocks, corresponding to the EU Habitats Directive Annex I habitat transition mire, also occur. These are separated from the reedbeds by small-sedge vegetation. To the north of Tullaher Lough there is a small area of <i>Betula</i> sp. wood and scrub. Species-rich hay meadows occur to the south-west of Tullaher Lough and there is improved grassland along the western boundary.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The great bulk of the site has been heavily exploited in the past by drainage and turf cutting and some areas have been reclaimed. Recent land use of the site consists of domestic peat cutting and grazing. In recent times peat cutting is mostly restricted to the cutover areas to the west. The area of high bog is small, but remains intact. The cutover to the east of the high bog has been reclaimed for agriculture and cattle graze on these grasslands and the improved grassland on the mineral ridge to the north. Damaging activities associated with these land uses include drainage and occasional burning. These activities have resulted in habitat loss and damage to the hydrological status of the high bog and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Tullaher Lough and Bog is a site of considerable conservation significance as it comprises a diverse site with lake, transition mire, and raised bog habitats. The site contains one of the few remaining examples of raised bog in Co. Clare and represents the south-western extreme of the range of raised bogs in Ireland (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Lorcan Scott.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Moyclare Bog, Co. Offaly 00581</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Moyclare Bog situated 4km west of Ferbane in Co. Offaly. It is a small bog that has been classified as a basin bog type as it is surrounded on all sides by low relief bedrock ridges. The bog has a simple long, narrow rectangular-oval shape. The site is underlain by Waulsortian Carboniferous limestone.  The subsoil geology of this bog and surrounding area is dominated by silty/stony till. The bog occurs in proximity to a number of important raised bogs close to the floodplain of the River Shannon.</p><p>The bog is notable for the relatively high proportion of Active raised bog (ARB) on the uncut dome. ARB occurs in the southern part of the bog and includes both central and sub-central ecotope.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the bog surface is active and very wet, though not quaking, with an almost 100% cover of bog mosses beneath a sparse cover of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and abundant Deergrass. Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxyccocos</i>) is especially abundant on lawns of the moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>. Rhynchosporion vegetation is best developed in the wettest central area of the high bog where numerous small pools occur. Typical plant species within these pool areas include the bog mosses <i>S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>, Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>). There are also a number of small lawn areas on the wet bog surfaces dominated by White Beak-sedge and, locally, the rare Brown Beak-sedge. Active bog moss growth approaches unusually close to the western margin of the bog.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Degraded raised bog is largely confined to the margins of the high bog area where drainage effects are most pronounced. In common with many areas of degraded raised bog the vegetation at this site is dominated by mixtures of Heather, Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>E. vaginatum</i>), Deergrass, Bog Asphodel and Carnation Sedge. Sphagnum cover is poor, typically &lt;20%, and there are other indicators of degradation such as the presence of Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>A small flushed hollow on the dome of the bog contains Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) and the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. The bog becomes drier towards the northern boundary, especially north of an old track which traverses the dome. In many of the driest areas of the high bog there is invasion of Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) onto the bog surface.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Other habitats include cutover bog, wet, broad-leaved, semi-natural woodland and wet grassland. Areas of cutover bog are colonised by <i>Ulex europaeus</i>, with <i>Juncus effusus</i> and <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i> in damper sections.

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Sheheree (Ardagh) Bog, Co. Kerry 000382</u></p><p>Sheheree Bog lies 2km south-east of Killarney in Co. Kerry, in a depression within a high ridge (103m asl). It has developed by succession from a small lake to a ridge basin bog with similarities to a raised bog. The bog is rather unique in an Irish context as it is the only raised bog system to be completely surrounded by a wet lagg zone.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog surface at Sheheree contains areas of both active and degraded bog.&nbsp;In general, about 50% of the high bog surface is rather dry, being dominated by Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and Western Gorse (<i>Ulex gallii</i>). Other frequent vascular plant species include Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>). The cover of mosses and lichens is generally low, with species more characteristic of dry conditions such as <i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. subnitens, Hypnum cupressiforme </i>and<i> Cladonia portentosa</i> most conspicuous. There are occasional wet hollows with bog mosses (<i>S. cuspidatum, S. auriculatum</i>) and species such as Round-leaved Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>) but these are generally rare.</p><p style='outline: none;'>A concentration of <i>Betula pubescens</i> and <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> trees grow towards the north-east of the site, beneath which abundant bog mosses grow. The open bog adjacent to this is quite wet and Vaccinium oxycoccos grows abundantly here. Surrounding the bog is a wet lagg area. The SAC also includes dry grassland fields which slope down to, and adjoin, the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The margins of the site remain relatively undisturbed. The high bog is being invaded by <i>Rhododendron ponticum</i> and <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, which may indicate drying of the bog. Cattle grazing has also been occurring on the high bog in recent years. Adjoining fields are grazed by cattle and sheep and fertilised to varying degrees. Land use practices here may impact on the bog habitat.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Sheheree Bog is of high conservation importance as it contains good examples of Active raised bog (ARB)&nbsp;and Degraded raised bog (DRB). Of particular note is that it is the only remaining raised bog in the country with an intact surrounding lagg system, and this makes it of especially high ecological interest.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>In addition, the site is the most south-westerly example of a raised bog in the country and is one of only two examples of the habitat in Co. Kerry. The presence of the protected (Flora (Protection) Order, 1999) plant species <i>Eriophorum gracile</i>, which is only known from approximately 25 sites in Ireland, adds to the conservation value of the site. The small size of this bog, coupled with the fact that it is a Nature Reserve, are positive factors for the future conservation of the site (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The southern and eastern margins are bounded by the River Lung and the old Ballaghaderreen railway line adjoins the north-west margin.</p><p>This bog has developed between a ridge and a river, and has a domed surface with an undulating pattern of hummocks and pools. There is a small plantation to the south-east of the high bog. To the south and east there is a semi-natural margin between the high bog and the River Lung. Cutover bog occurs around the remaining margins of the high bog, and in particular on the northern margin where it grades into agricultural land. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the western raised bog type,&nbsp;consisting of Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), Deergrass, Carnation Sedge and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>. The pools contain the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>, with White Beak-sedge, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>). The hummocks are formed by bog mosses such as <i>S. magellanicum, S.&nbsp;papillosum </i>and<i> S. capillifolium</i>, Heather, Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and Deergrass. The hummocks also contain support Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Round-leaved Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Where the Lung River forms a natural southern boundary to Tullaghanrock Bog, a strip of wet grassland habitat runs between the bog and the river. In the south-west there is active regeneration of cutover, with extensive patches of <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> and E<i>riophorum angustifolium</i> occurring here. Other areas of old cutover bog now support <i>Molinia caerulea</i> and <i>Ulex europaeus</i>. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current land use on the site consists of a small forestry plantation on the south-eastern high bog and another on the western margin. Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural grassland on the west and north-west margins and agricultural grazing occurs on the southern boundary. Recent peat cutting has not been carried out on this site. Most of the drains are old and infilling, there are new deep drains around the forestry.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Tullaghanrock Bog supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummock/hollow complexes, pools, flushes, and regenerating cutover (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Photo: Google Street View.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Lough Namucka Bog, Co. Galway NPWS Site Code: 000220</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Lough Namucka Bog NHA is situated about 6 km south-east of Ballinlough in Counties Galway and Roscommon.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog, and a small lake.  It is bordered along most of its western side by the Island River.<br /></p><p>Lough Namucka Bog consists of three lobes, the western-most of which is completely separated from the others by areas of cutover peat.  There are wet areas with well-developed hummock/hollow systems and pools.  A lake, Lough Namucka, adjoins the southern-most lobe of the bog, forming a semi-natural margin and possible lagg zone.  A number of interesting features occur on the bog, including several flushes, a dry ridge and swallow holes.  The cutover areas surrounding the bog have either been abandoned or have been reclaimed for agriculture, and there is one small area of coniferous forestry at the south of the site.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog at Lough Namucka supports many of the species typical of a Western Raised Bog, such as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), many bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>.  In the centre of the bog there is a very wet and quaking region which consists of inter-connecting pools and island hummocks.  The pools are filled with the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), with the bog moss <i>S. magellanicum </i>and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) at the margins.  Between the pools there are quaking lawns of Bog Asphodel, White Beak-sedge and the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i>.  In the southern-most lobe another pool system occurs.  The pools are again filled with the bog moss<i> S. cuspidatum</i> and Bogbean.  The large dry hummocks are topped by Ling Heather, lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) and the moss <i>Pleurozium schreberi</i>.  Bog Asphodel occurs in the wet hollows. </p><p style='outline: none;'>A number of flushes are found on the high bog, some of which occur in association with the lake.  The lake supports Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>), Common Club-rush (<i>Scirpus lacustris</i>), White Water-lily (<i>Nymphaea alba</i>) and Bottle Sedge (<i>Carex rostrata</i>).  Just north of the lake an extensive flush occurs which is dominated by Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Common Reed, Common Cottongrass and Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>).  Another flush occurs to the east of this, with open water and lawns of the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> and Bog Asphodel, along with tufts of Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>).  There are also a number of swallow holes with Ling Heather and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>).  A small dry ridge occurs at the eastern side of the high bog and is covered in Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>), Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>), Ling Heather and Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus monogyna</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting around most of the margins of the high bog, and drainage associated with this.  Large portions of the bog have been burnt in the past.  Significant areas of cutover bog have been drained, cleared and reclaimed for agricultural purposes, and one small area at the south of the site has been planted with coniferous forestry.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Leitrim and Longford.  The River Shannon lies to the west of the site.  The site comprises a relatively large raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover, and it forms part of a bog complex within this area.  The site is bounded by agricultural land on all margins.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site comprises a large flat raised bog, separated into four lobes by a railway line and the main Longford/Carrick-on-Shannon road.  The fragmented nature of the high bog has led to the overall desiccation of this habitat, particularly to the eastern lobes.  Cutover bog occurs around much of the larger western lobe.  Regeneration has occurred on some areas of cutover around the high bog margins.  A large flush runs along the centre of the main western lobe.  An area of coniferous plantation is present on the high bog to the north.  A modified natural channel flows from the south end of the bog into the River Shannon to the west.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the Midland Raised Bog type, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.). Other species present include Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>).  In places the high bog topography forms wet flats and hollows.  An extensive flush runs the full length of the larger western lobe.  A number of Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) trees occur in association with the flush.  Bog moss (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) cover is generally good in this area and forms spongy carpets towards the south.  Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) dominates towards the southern end of the bog.  Bog Myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) also occurs here.     </p><p>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting along some of the margins of the western lobe.  An area of old cutaway to the east has been reclaimed for pasture.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning.  Fire damage was recorded in the 1980s but since then there has been good bog moss regeneration on the high bog. These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Aghnamona Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance, comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  The site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats including hummock/hollow complexes, and there are some pools present&nbsp;(Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Galway, NPWS Site Code: 002344</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Annaghbeg Bog is located 5 km south-east of Ahascragh in Co. Galway. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog was originally part of an extensive system of bogs that, with the exception for Annaghbeg, have now been cutover.  Annaghbeg Bog is in close proximity to Crit Island NHA (254) and Killure Bog NHA (1283).  Although this bog has no pools it is wet and quaking in places with hummocks throughout the high bog.  Cutover is found all around the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>).  The vegetation on the bog is uniform and dominated by Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), Deergrass, Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>).  Close to the centre of the bog the surface is wet and quaking, bog moss cover is at its highest and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) is present.  Hummocks of the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i> are common and <i>S. magellanicum </i>is also frequent, the hummock forming bog moss <i>S. austinii</i> was less common.  Away from the centre of the bog Sphagnum cover is low.  Bog Asphodel dominates to the south of the site, in areas that have been recently burnt, and towards the south-east Ling Heather becomes more dominant on dryer hummocks.  In the east of the site there is an old townland boundary drain that is in-filled with the aquatic bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>, Bog Asphodel and White Beak-sedge.  In the adjacent drain Sundew (<i>Drosera</i> sp.) was also recorded.  The high bog is surrounded by cutover, much of which has been reclaimed as agricultural grassland, however small areas in the east and north-west have patches of Gorse (<i>Ulex</i> sp.) scrub.</p><p>Common frog, a species listed in the Red Data Book, has been recorded on the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting and agriculture.  Active peat-cutting is taking place in the west and south of the site.  The cutting in the south seems to be more intensive and commercial.  Areas of cutover all around the bog have been reclaimed for agriculture and much of the grassland seems to have been improved.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Willy Crowley.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Arragh More Bog, Co. Tipperary 000640</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Arragh More Bog NHA is located approximately 9.5 km north-east of Borrisokane in Co. Tipperary.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is partly bounded in the east by a road.</p><p>This site is the remnant of a large bog that was originally part of a system of interconnecting bogs.  The bogs are now separated by roads and cutover that has been reclaimed for agriculture.  Arragh More Bog is split by many mineral ridges, which is a general feature of the local landscape of mineral ridges running between areas of raised bog.  On the high bog there are areas of hummocks and pools, especially towards the south.  There is a wooded flush towards the north of the site and in this area coniferous forestry has been planted on the high bog.  Cutover is found around much of the site and is forested in the north-west.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>).  In addition to the more common hummock-forming bog mosses, <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> and <i>S. papillosum</i>, some hummocks of the relatively scarce <i>S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and <i>S. fuscum</i> have been recorded.  The majority of the bog has poor quality algal pools.  However, a small area towards the south of the site has pools that contain the aquatic bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>, and here hummocks of <i>S. austinii</i> occur more commonly.  Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) is common in the more degraded areas of the bog where the algal pools are more frequent.  A small number of ridges with Common Reed (Phragmites australis) are located towards the centre of the bog.  There is a large flush in the north of the bog, but the coniferous forestry planted in the vicinity will have had a negative impact.  Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>) has been found in the wettest flush areas and the bog moss <i>S. recurvum</i> has also been recorded.  Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), Bog Asphodel, and Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) are found on marginal areas around the entire high bog.  Coniferous forestry is planted on the high bog in the north-west of the site and the plantation continues onto the cutover in this area.  Small areas of birch (<i>Betula</i> sp.) scrub are found on the cutover all around the site and in the west of the site there is an area of Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) dominated scrub.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Hen Harrier, a species that is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, has been recorded on this bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting, forestry and agriculture.  Mechanised peat-cutting is mostly taking place in the east of the site.  Coniferous forestry was formerly planted on an area of high bog and cutover in the north-west of the site (see below).  Small areas of cutover around the site have been reclaimed for agriculture.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  The most damaging agricultural activity that is affecting the high bog is the pumping of farm slurry onto the centre of the bog.  All of these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Arragh More Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance, comprising as it does, a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  The site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummocks, pools and a flush (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work to clear a conifer plantation from the surface of the bog and block ditches has been undertaken by <b>Coillte LIFE </b>(see below).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</b> (LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The bog mosses <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>and<i> S. capillifolium</i> are common between pools with some <i>S. austinii</i> also recorded.  To the west of the centre of the site there are many tear pools containing the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> and with Common Cottongrass (<i>E. angustifoilum</i>) and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) found around the edges.  Some pools contain the bog moss <i>S. auriculatum </i>and Brown Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>).  There are also some small hummocks of the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea </i>found amongst the pools and the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i> is growing on an island in one of the larger pools.  On the margins of the central pools complex carpets of the bog mosses <i>S. magellanicum</i> and <i>S. tenellum</i> and occasional patches of<i> S. fuscum</i> have been noted.  The flush in the centre of the site is dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and occasional Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).  There is a thin cutover margin in the west with Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) woodland.  In the north the cutover is dominated by Purple Moor-grass, Ling Heather and Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>).</p><p>Current landuses on the site include forestry that is found on the high bog in the north-east of the site and on cutover in the south and east of the site.  There is active peat-cutting in the north and north-west of the site.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog, although there has been no recent burning here.  There are old drains along the tracks in the centre of the site that will have a damaging effect.  All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  There is also some dumping occurring at the start of the bog track.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Aughrim Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Ayle Lower Bog, Co. Clare 000993</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>This site is located approximately 5 km north-east of Tulla in Co. Clare.  The site comprises a lake and a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  This is one of the most western raised bogs in Ireland.  The site is bordered by a stream at the south and south-west, by a road at the north and by agricultural fields at the east.  </p><p>Ayle Lower Bog consists of two main lobes of high bog, separated by a small stream.  The larger, western lobe is distinctly domed.  There are wet areas on the high bog which consist of bog moss hummocks and lawns.  Large areas of old peat-cutting exist around much of the site.  However, the banks of the stream that runs through the site appear to form semi-natural margins.  Hand-cutting of peat is carried out in a limited area at the north of the site, but otherwise peat-cutting has been abandoned and large areas at the north of the site are regenerating. At the east of the site there is an area of coniferous forestry on cutover and a small lake, Errinagh Lough.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog at Ayle Lower possesses many of the species typical of Western Raised Bogs in Ireland, such as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) and bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.).  At the east of the main lobe, in the wettest part of the bog, there are bog moss hummocks and lawns, with species such as <i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. magellanicum </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i>.  Other species present on the bog include Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), Cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.), Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) and lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.).  The western side of the main lobe of high bog is much drier and is dominated by Bog Asphodel, Carnation Sedge and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>).  There is a small depression in the centre of the bog with scattered Bog-myrtle.  The cutover to the west of the site consists of wet fields between the high bog and the stream.  At the northern boundary there are areas of scrub, with species such as Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), Willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.) and Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>).  Regeneration of bog mosses is occurring in this area and Royal Fern (<i>Osmunda regalis</i>) and Purple Moor-grass are also found.  Along the stream margins Downy Birch, Gorse and Bramble (<i>Rubus fruticosus </i>agg.) woodland is found.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting, both abandoned and active,  mainly along the northern margin of the high bog, and the drainage associated with this.  Large portions of the bog have been burned in the past and areas of cutover bog have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.  Dumping is carried out along the roadsides.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Ayle Lower Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  Its importance is increased by the fact that it is one of the most western raised bogs in Ireland and appears to have semi-natural margins along the stream that runs through it (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The northern and western margins of the site are bounded by commercial conifer plantation.</p><p>The site consists of a small relatively intact bog.  Hummocks/hollows and pools are found on the site with algal filled tear pools.  Three small flushes are also found on the site. There is forestry on the north-eastern high bog and mixed woodland occurs on the cutover along the northern margin.  Cutover bog occurs on the southern margins of the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a raised bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), White beaked-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>), Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>).  Bog mosses are frequent on the site and include (<i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. magellanicum </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i>).  Hummocks/hollows and pools are found on the bog.  The hummocks are colonised by bog mosses including S<i>. fuscum, S. austinii</i>; the pools and hollows are colonised by the bogs mosses <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>and<i> S. capillifolium with S. cuspidatum</i> the aquatic bog moss in the wettest areas.  Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) is also found in the hollows.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>There are three flushes on the bog which support Bog Myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Bog-rosemary, Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccus</i>), Ling Heather, Carnation Sedge and Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>). Mosses present in the flushes include <i>Sphagnum austinii, S subnitens, S. auriculatum, Pleurozium schreberi, Pseudoscleropodium purum </i>and<i> Leucobryum glaucum</i>.  Stunted Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) and Sitka Spruce (<i>Picea sitchensis</i>) are found in two of the flushes.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the cutover on this bog is afforested; along the northern and eastern margins there is a thin band of mixed woodland dominated by Downy Birch and Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>).  There is a good diversity of lichens present because the site has not been burnt in the recent past, in some locations the lichens are suppressing the bog mosses.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting on the south-eastern corner.  Forestry is found on the north-east corner of the high bog and along the northern margin of the site.  Unlike many other bogs, Ballygar does not appear to have been burnt in over ten years.  Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.  Forestry and agricultural reclamation result in drainage of the site, which leads to habitat loss and damage to the bog’s hydrological status, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Ballygar Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.

Photo: Mary Catherine Gallagher.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Ballymacegan Bog, Co. Tipperary 000642</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Ballymacegan Bog NHA is situated in the floodplain of the River Shannon approximately 7 km south west of Banagher Co Offaly and 6 km north-west of Rathcabban in Co. Tipperary.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  Pasture grassland occurs to the south of the site.  The River Shannon runs just north and west of the site and Redwood Bog is to the east.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site consists of a small floodplain raised bog.  The high bog is flat and uniform, with active peat-cutting on the south-west, south and the eastern boundaries.  Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) scrub occurs on the old cutover.  Flushes are found to the south of the high bog.  The bog is surrounded by callow grassland on the west and northern boundaries.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midlands Raised Bog, and includes such species as cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium </i>and<i> E. vaginatum</i>), Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>), Carnation sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) and sundews (<i>Drosera anglica </i>and<i> D. rotundifolia</i>).  Midland Raised Bog indicator species found on the bog include Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and the bog moss S<i>phagnum magellanicum</i>.  Hummock-forming bog mosses on the site include <i>Sphagnum fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i>, while <i>S. cuspidatum</i> and <i>S. palustre</i> are found in hollows, pools and drains.  The site supports a number of other moss species including <i>Campylopus introflexus, Hypnum jutlandicum </i>and<i> Pleurozium schreberi,</i> and the liverworts <i>Frullania tamarisci, Lejeunea ulicina, Calypogeia muellerana </i>and<i> Odontoschisma sphagni</i>.  Tear pools surrounded by pools colonised by algae occur to the south of the site in the vicinity of a flush.  These pools support such species as the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Bog-sedge (<i>Carex limosa</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>The flush to the south of the high bog supports Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>), Bog-rosemary, Cranberry, Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>), birch and the bog moss Sphagnum recurvum.  A number of epiphytic lichens including <i>Hypogymnia physodes, Evernia prunastri </i>and<i> Lecanora chlarotera</i> occur on the birch trees.  The cutover has areas of birch scrub and humid grassland.</p><p>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting around the south and east of the site.  Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes to the south of the site.  Peat-cutting on the site appears to be mechanised peat extraction for domestic purposes.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage around the high bog and burning of the high bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Ballymacegan Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance, comprising as it does, a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  The site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummock/hollow complexes, pools and flushes, as well as a number of scarce plant species (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Ballynagrenia and Ballinderry Bog, Co. Westmeath 000674&nbsp;</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Ballynagrenia and Ballinderry Bog NHA is located 2 km north-east of Moate in Co. Westmeath. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The site is bounded on the west by the road between Moate and Moyvoughly and on the south by an area of remnant raised bog.</p><p>The site consists of a high bog dome known as Ballynagrenia Bog, which once formed part of a much larger bog complex. The bog is separated from a heavily impacted bog to the south by an esker ridge and cutover. The centre of both Ballynagrenia Bog is wet and with hummocks and pools. There is a large flush in a depression in the north of the site. Cutover bog occurs all around the margins of the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog mostly has vegetation typical of the Midland Raised Bog type, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>). Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) is recorded only in the centre of the site where it has been recorded with the lichens <i>Cladonia portentosa, C. floerkeana, </i>and<i> C. pyxidata</i>, and the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i>. The centre of the high bog is generally wet and spongy with a good cover of the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. papillosum, S. austinii, S. fuscum, </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i>. Pools in these central areas contain the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. The hollows at the centre of bog contain Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. The pools here also contain Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>). There is an old drain running across the centre of the bog which contains the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum </i>and is in-filling from the sides with Hare’s-tail Cottongrass and Bog Asphodel. At the eastern end the drain connects with long tear pools, some of which contain Great Sundew and the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. However, some of these tear pools are filled with algae and seem to be drying out. The main flush on Ballnagrenia is dominated by Ling Heather with patches of Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>). A second small flush to the south of this is dominated by Ling Heather and Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>The old cutover to the west and east of the high bog is dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub and is being colonised by Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>). The esker ridge to the south of the site supports semi-natural wet grassland and is bordered by sections of old cutover.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Hares have been recorded on the site, as have Snipe and Meadow Pipits.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Around the margins of the site, peat-cutting is evident with recent peat-cutting to the north-west and east of Ballynagrenia. There has been some reclamation of cutover to the west of the site for grazing. To the north of the high bog there has been agricultural reclamation of Downy Birch scrub on old cutover. Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site (both old and recent) and extensive burning of the high bog. The bog has been burnt in recent times. These are all activities that have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability. There is also some dumping along tracks on the cutover to the west and east of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Ballynagrenia and Ballinderry Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a largely intact raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.

Roscommon, NPWS Site Code:  000591</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Bella Bridge Bog is located approximately 2.5 km north-east of Frenchpark in Co. Roscommon.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is bounded in the west by the Breedoge River.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>This site is the remnant of a larger bog that has now been cutover and reclaimed for agriculture.  The site was formerly linked to Cornaveagh Bog NHA (000603) but an area of cutover now separate the two.  Two mineral ridges are found in the east and south of the site.  There are areas of hummocks and a few pools, mostly in the south of the bog, but there is no longer a system of pools.  A flush occurs in the north-west of the site.  Cutover is found mostly in the northern half of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a North-Western Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> sp.), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) and the moss Racomitrium lanuginosum.  A disused track runs across the site and south of this the bog surface is wet and there is a deep carpet of bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) present.  Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) are common in this area and Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>) has also been recorded.  The hummock-forming bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> and <i>S. papillosum</i> have been recorded on the site, as have the relatively scarce<i> S. austinii</i> and <i>S. fuscum</i>.  Although there is no longer a system of pools there are a few pools remaining in the south of the site which support the aquatic bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>.  There is a flush in the north-west of the bog with Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) and Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>).  Old cutover in the south and east of the site has been recolonised by Ling Heather, Tormentil (<i>Potentilla erecta</i>) and cottongrass.  Along the southern boundary of the site areas of cutover have been colonised by Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) and Purple Moor-grass.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting and agriculture.  Mechanised peat-cutting is taking place mostly in the north-east and west of the site.  Areas of cutover all around the bog have been reclaimed for agriculture but there are only a few fields of improved grassland within the site.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  Dumping of domestic waste and old cars takes place along the tracks on this site (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The north-western margins of the site are bounded by roads and those on the south-east are bounded mainly by scrub and woodland.<br /></p><p>The site consists of one crescent-shaped lobe, which is quite flat.  There is an absence of permanent pools on the high bog.  The raised bog is of particular interest as it is one of the most easterly remaining raised bogs in the country.  The peripheral area of abandoned cutover bog has developed into a range of different habitats.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog vegetation is typical of the Midland Raised Bog type, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>).

Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) are also found on the bog, although not in abundance.  A number of species of lichen (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) are recorded from this site.  There are a number of habitat types found on the cutover areas of the bog.  These include areas of wet grassland dominated by Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>), Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Yorkshire Fog (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>), areas with dense Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) cover, Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub, Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) woodland and Ash (<i>Fraxinus exelsior</i>) dominated semi-natural woodland. </p><p>Irish Hare, a Red Data Book species, has been recorded at the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting around the edge of the high bog, and the drainage associated with this.

Kerry, NPWS Site Code:  001352</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Bunaruddee Bog is situated approximately 4 km west of Moyvane in Co. Kerry.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is surrounded by streams to the east and west and a river to the south.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The site consists of a Western Raised Bog, which has developed on a floodplain of the Galey River.  It supports a range of characteristic species of bogs including western indicator species and lichens.  The southern section of the bog is the most intact. There was a small central quaking area, with hummock/hollow complexes but no pools, which has been more actively cut and drained since the last survey.  The bog had a good compliment of Sphagnum species. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog.  The high bog is dominated by Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium </i>and<i> Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) with abundant Bog Mrytle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).  There is a good layer of bog moss growing underneath the Ling Heather.  Bunnaruddee Bog also supports a good cover of Lichen (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) as it has not been burnt in a while.  Western indicators present on the bog include Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), Lousewort (<i>Pedicularis sylvatica</i>), the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>.  The wet central area with quaking bog and hummock/hollow complexes prior to being developed for peat cutting supported <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> in the hollows with frequent <i>Sphagnum austinii&nbsp;</i>hummocks.  Other species of interest recorded on the high bog include Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and seven species of Sphagnum including <i>Sphagnum subnitens </i>and<i> S. tenellum</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The cutover supports a range of habitats including humid grasslands, improved grassland, forestry, old peat-cutting and active peat-cutting.  There are extensive areas of humid grassland with Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) to the north, west and north-east.  In places, cutover supports Ling Heather.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site comprise active peat-cutting on all margins.  Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes to the south, east, west and north of the site.  There is a small conifer plantation on the eastern margin of the high bog.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning of the high bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>This site is the remnant of a larger bog that that has now been cutover and reclaimed for agriculture.  The site is in close proximity to Ardraigue Bog NHA (1224) and Meeneen Bog NHA (310).  Although this bog only has algal pools it is wet and quaking in places with hummocks throughout the high bog.  There are vegetated mounds found in the centre and north of the high bog.  Cutover is found all around the high bog and the south of the site is dominated by deciduous forestry with dry woodland on an esker ridge in the extreme south.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> sp.), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>).  The vegetation on the bog is uniform and dominated by Ling Heather and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) with Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Deergrass and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>).  There are large mounds on the high bog, which are visible on the aerial photographs that are dominated by Ling Heather and Common Reed (Phragmites australis).  Some smaller mounds also occur with Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Ling Heather and lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> sp.).  The bog surface is wet and quaking in the centre and has good bog moss cover throughout.  Hummocks of the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i> are common and <i>S. magellanicum</i> is also frequent, the hummock forming bog moss <i>S. austinii</i> was less common as was <i>S. subnitens</i>.  Many hollows contain the aquatic bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) and Round-leaved Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>) have been recorded on the bog.  Sphagnum hummocks that are drying out and are often dominated by Ling Heather are common in the south of the site and the one <i>S. fuscum</i> hummock was recorded in this area.  In this region of the bog there are algal hollows and lawns of Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), also indicating that the bog is drying out.  An old drain on the north-west margin of the high bog is in-filled with the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> and <i>S. magellanicum</i> with Cottongrasses and Sundew species.  In the south of the site Birch (<i>Betula</i> sp.) is encroaching onto the high bog and wet woodland occurs on cutover between the high bog and an esker ridge.  Dry woodland with Ash (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) and Oak (<i>Quercus</i> sp.) occurs on the esker ridge in the extreme south of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting and agriculture.  Active peat-cutting is taking place all along the eastern and western margins of the high bog.

The site comprises two sections raised bog which once formed part of a large raised bog. The two sections of the site are separated by an extensive area of cutover bog that has been subject to historic and recent peat cutting. The site includes areas of both high bog and cutover bog. The site is mostly bounded by reclaimed grassland and turbary roads.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog consists of two discrete sections of high bog referred to as a northern and southern section. A number of tracks cross the northern section of the site. There is a large central area of cutover separating the two intact portions of high bog at the north and south of the site. Both sections of the site contain active raised bog with hummocks and pools, which are Sphagnum filled.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog vegetation in the north and south sections is typical of raised bogs in Ireland, containing species such as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Bog Rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.). On the north and south part of the site there are large relatively intact area of high bog. These have numerous pools, many filled by the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> and including Long-leaved Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) and Bog Bean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>). The surface is not quaking and is dominated by Ling Heather, with Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Cottongrass species, mainly <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>. The White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) is common, especially in wet hollows. There are frequent low hummocks low or undulating carpets of <i>Sphagnum austinii, S. magellanicum, </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i> with occasional <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i> hummocks.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse consists of peat-cutting around much of the site. There is much drainage associated with this, and with old areas of peat-cutting. Large portions of the two high bog areas have been burnt repeatedly in the past. Some areas of old cutover have been reclaimed for agriculture and trackways have been built through the northern part of the site. These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Carrickynaghtan Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland. It is one of the few remaining raised bogs which developed on the former floodplain of the River Shannon (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Cashel Bog (Leitrim), Co. Leirtim 001405</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Cashel Bog is one of a cluster of bogs that is situated mainly in Co. Leitrim.  The site lies halfway between Lough Bofin and Lough Rinn, and the River Shannon is about 7 km due south. This is a small bog, situated between drumlins and surrounded by agricultural land Corracramph Bog NHA lies adjacent  to the west of the site.</p><p>Most of the bog surface is wet and there is good pool development in places.  A small area of wet scrub occurs to the south and west of the site.  Old abandoned cutaway is found to the east.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Most of the bog has vegetation typical of Midland Raised Bog type with Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), and Cotton grass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>).  Other species present include Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>).  The central area is very wet and quaking in places and there is an interlocking pool system and (Rhyncosporion) hollows.  The scarce Brown Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>) occurs around pool edges.  Overall, Bog Moss (Sphagnum spp.) cover is high, with abundant <i>S. capillifolium</i> forming lawns in places and many Sphagnum filled pools.  The eastern edge is slightly drier with Ling Heather dominant.  The western side has been cut and there are flushed areas with Hard Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>), the moss <i>Polytricum commune </i>and Bog Myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).  Elsewhere to the west, the high bog has been damaged by burning with Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and Deergrass now dominating.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Old cutover to the east of the site is dominated in places by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Ling Heather, Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and Hard Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>).  Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinium</i>) and Common Bent (<i>Agrostis capillaris</i>) are also present.  Elsewhere, Sphagnum pools occur.  To the south a small area of wet scrub woodland with Willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.) and occasional Ash (<i>Fraxinum excelsior</i>) occurs.  An area of Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) scrub with Blackberry (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i> agg.) and Purple Moor-grass is found along the western bog margin.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Red Grouse, a species that is becoming increasingly rare in Ireland has been recorded on the site. Greenland White-fronted Geese are known to use the site for refuge and foraging.</p><p>Current landuse on the site consists of mechanical peat-cutting along the northern and southern margins.  Some reclamation has occurred around the bog margins.  Domestic dumping occurs on the site.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning.  Some areas to the west and east have been burnt in the recent past, but there is evidence of good recovery.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Cashel Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This high bog supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats including some hummock/hollow complexes and interlocking pools.  The use of the site by Greenland White-fronted Geese adds further interest (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Castle Ffrench East Bog, Co. Galway 001244</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Castle Ffrench East Bog is located 5km west of Ballyforan in Co. Galway.  The site consists of a small, intact raised bog, situated in a region of intensive peat development.  It can be accessed from local roads to the north and west.  There are extensive areas of cutover peat to the south and east and along with Castle Ffrench West Bog to the south-west, this site represents the only intact raised bog habitat remaining in this region.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site is a raised bog consisting of areas of both high bog and cutover.  The high bog has active bog moss (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) growth and small pool systems to the north, west and east, some of which have dried out, indicating a lowering water-table.  Two series of swallow-holes and two flushed areas are also present.  There are also a number of overgrown drains to the north of the high bog.  Flooded cutover, wet grassland and dry grassland occur around the margins of the high bog.  There is also a small wet woodland and a small dry semi-natural woodland present on the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, dominated by Common Cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) with Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.).  The drier areas of the high bog to the west and south are dominated by Ling Heather and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) is quite abundant especially in wetter areas towards the centre of the high bog along with the moss (<i>Campylopus atrovirens</i>).  There is good regeneration of bog mosses here with <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>and<i> S. capillifolium (</i>but no<i> S. austinii</i>) and the surface is quaking.  The northern pool system is the remnant of a much larger system with most of the pools drying out and containing algae.  The small pool system to the west has pools filled with the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> and between the pools Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) dominates with Deergrass and Cottongrasses.  There is little bog moss, but some unburnt Ling Heather hummocks are present.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>In the east a tear pool system with a north-south aligment occurs close to the high bog margin.  It is wet and quaking with the bog mosses (<i>S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>) and Sundew (Drosera spp.).  A flush with Purple moor-grass (<i>Molina caerulea</i>) and Bog Myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) occurs to the north-east of the site with some small Birch (<i>Betula</i> spp.) also present.  The flushed area to the south-west has a carpet of bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) with Purple moor-grass, Bog Myrtle and abundant Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>).  This flush appears to be drying out due to drainage.  A small natural drainage channnel with swallow-holes occurs to the north of the site.  Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtilis</i>), Bog moss (<i>Sphagnum auriculatum</i>), Carnation Sedge and Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) are present.  Stunted Birch line this channel and Ling Heather with Lichen dominate the surrounding vegetation.  A larger swallow-hole system occurs to the south-east of the high bog with tall Birch, Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), Holly (<i>Ilex aquifolium</i>) and Bilberry.</p><p style='outline: none;'>A dry semi-natural woodland with Oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.), Hazel (<i>Corylus avellana</i>) and Holly occurs on a small mineral ridge to the south of the site and a small flooded Birch wood is present on cutover to the north-west.  Dry grassland also occurs along the southern ridge and flooded cutover and wet grassland occur around the margins of the site.  Some of the old cutover is wet with Purple moor-grass, Bog Myrtle and regenerating bog mosses.</p><p>Current landuse on the site consists of agriculture and mechanical peat-cutting to the north and north-west.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning.  There is very little new drainage on the high bog, but large portions of the bog are being burnt at regular intervals with dead hummocks and burnt Ling Heather evident.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  However the site is quite wet and some bog moss (Sphagnum spp.) regeneration is occurring and this will probably improve if burning stops. Some dumping also occurs by the roadside. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Castle Ffrench East Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a relatively intact raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This site supports a range of raised bog habitats including pool systems, flushes, swallow holes and is showing signs of active regeneration.  The presence of woodland and dry grassland adds to the diversity of the site (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Castle Ffrench West Bog, Co. Galway 000280&nbsp;</u></p><p>The site is a raised bog consisting of areas of both high bog and cutover. The high bog is of good quality with a high dome. A significant portion of the high bog is extremely wet and quaking. Part of this consists of large, inter-connecting pools with low flat ‘lawns’ between. The rest of this wet area is a wooded flush. A section of high bog has been planted with conifers in the north-east, while there is continuous forestry on cutaway along the north and west margin of the site. There is some wet regenerating cutover to the south-west.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog, dominated by Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), with the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i>, liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea </i>and Fir Clubmoss (<i>Huperzia selago</i>) occurring quite commonly. Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) is present but not dominant on the high bog and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) is common in places. The bog has a wet and quaking area with large, inter-connecting pools containing the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, and low flat lawns in between. Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) grows very vigorously here. However, due to burning, bog moss cover on these lawns is poor and they are dominated by Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>). To the north these pools grade into a wooded flush, which is quaking and which supports Scot’s Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) trees, some of which are quite mature, over a thick mat of vegetation. This vegetation includes an abundance of Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>) and Cranberry as well as Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>) and other species including bog mosses and orchids (<i>Dactylorhiza</i> spp.).</p><p style='outline: none;'>The cutover to the south-west is very wet and regenerating, with good bog moss growth, Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>), Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and abundant Cranberry. The mosses, <i>Calliergonella cuspidata </i>and<i> Aulacomnium palustre</i> are also present.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of forestry and recent and historic peat cutting. Damaging activities associated with these include drainage and burning with large portions of the bog being burnt at regular intervals. These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Castle Ffrench West Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance, comprising as it does, a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland. The site supports a range of raised bog habitats including a pool system and a wooded flush. This bog although small and damaged by extensive cutting and burning, is unusual in having such a relatively large area of wet quaking habitat. The presence of the wooded flush adds to the conservation value of the site (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: George Smith.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Clonydonnin Bog, Co. Westmeath 000565</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Clonydonnin Bog NHA is located on the border of Co. Offaly and Co. Westmeath, approximately 13 km south-east of Athlone. The site comprises an area of raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The site consists of one dome of high bog, fringed with areas of cutover bog, scrub and low-lying agricultural land.  Although the bog surface is relatively dry, the cover of bog mosses is good.  However, the typical hummock/hollow topography of a raised bog is poorly-developed.  The area of cutover associated with this bog is quite limited, and much of it has been reclaimed for agriculture or overgrown with scrub.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>This high bog is an example of a Midlands Raised Bog, with species such as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) and Cottongrass species (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.).  Other species found here include Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>). Bog mosses found on the site include <i>Sphagnum papillosum, S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. austinii</i>; a number of lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) are also found.  The cutover areas of the site are mainly dominated by Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) and/or Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub, or by areas of Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>).  There are also areas of Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) and Blackberry (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i> agg.).  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of some peat-cutting around the edge of the high bog.  In the past this occurred in localised areas at the south-east, west and north-east of the bog.  However, peat-cutting has decreased, and is now restricted to two areas at the north-east and south.  The older areas of cutover bog have been reclaimed for agriculture (at the north-east and south-west), and scrub or rough grassland have developed on other sections.  Damaging activities associated with this landuse include drainage and burning.  The site appears to be subject to regular episodes of burning, with most of the surface having been subjected to burning within the past decade.  A recent fire has damaged two areas of the bog at the northern side.  Recurrent burning at the site is having a drying effect on the bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  There has also been recent drainage on the high bog, involving the excavation of numerous shallow drains across the surface of the site.  However, these are already infilling with vegetation and rewetting is occurring in the centre of the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Clonydonnin Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

There are wet areas on the high bog which consist of flushes and a small area with pools and hummock/hollow systems at the south-west of the site.  A mineral ridge protrudes into the site at the north.  Active peat-cutting is carried out around much of the site, but mainly at the south and north.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog at Cloonageeher possesses many of the species typical of raised bogs in Ireland, such as Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.).  At the south-west of the site there is a small pool and hummock complex.  Apart from this, pools are scarce and algal hollows become more common.  There is a predominance of low bog moss hummocks (mainly <i>Sphagnum subnitens </i>and<i> S. tenellum</i>) and typical fire-damaged vegetation.  There are also a number of flushed areas on the bog.  At the centre of the bog there is a large flush which is dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and has been seriously damaged by fire.  To the north-west there is a wet and somewhat quaking flush, dominated by Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).  Bog Asphodel is common in this area, along with Cross-leaved Heath and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and there are hummocks of <i>Sphagnum subnitens, S. papillosum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting mainly along the northern and southern margins of the high bog, and the drainage associated with this.

Cutover is found all around the site apart from the middle of the southern margin.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog, with species including cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium </i>and<i> E. vaginatum</i>), Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>).  Western Raised Bog indicator species found on the bog include Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> and the mosses <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i> and <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i>.  Midland Raised Bog indicator species also found on the bog include Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>.  Pools and hummocks occur in the wettest part of the bog to the north-east.  The bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> fills the pools while the hummocks are comprised of bog mosses, including the scarce <i>Sphagnum fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i>.  Algal, tear pools and low hummocks occur in the south-western and south-eastern lobes.  While most of the pools and tear pools contain algae, some support the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>).  <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i> has also been found here.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The flushes and associated swallow holes support Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molina caerulea</i>), Ling Heather, Field Wood-rush (<i>Luzula campestris</i>) and Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>). The flush nearest the central track has a subterranean stream.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The cutover supports a range of habitats including regenerating cutover, Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub, humid grassland and areas of both old peat cutting and active peat cutting.  The regenerating cutover supports the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. papillosum</i>  and <i>S. capillifolium</i>, rushes (<i>Juncus</i> spp.) and cottongrasses.  Some regenerating cutover also supports Bulrush (<i>Typha latifolia</i>). There are extensive areas of humid grassland to the east and west, with Purple Moor-grass, Soft Rush and the moss <i>Polytrichum commune</i>.  Gorse scrub occurs on old cutover to the west, while the eastern cutover region is grazed and has a high cover of bryophytes and a variety of sedge (<i>Carex</i> spp.) species.</p><p>Red Grouse, a species that is becoming increasingly rare in Ireland has been recorded on the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site comprises active peat-cutting around the north, east and south-eastern margins of the site; areas of old peat-cutting occur to the west, south-east and east of the site.  Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes to the south, east and west of the site.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning of the high bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Clare, NPWS Site Code:  002037</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Cloonloum More Bog is situated approximately 5 km south-west of Tulla in Co. Clare. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The<br /></p><p>north-western margin of the site is bounded by a road, while the other margins are bounded by areas of cutover and grassland.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog consists of one crescent-shaped lobe. There is an absence of permanent pools and hummocks/hollows on the high bog and there are large areas of cutover. This raised bog is of particular interest as it is one of the few remaining raised bogs in the county. A small lake, Lough Gara, is included at the south of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog vegetation is typical of raised bogs in Ireland, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>). Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) is found on this bog, although not in abundance. The bog moss (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) cover is quite variable, with species such as <i>S. capillifolium, S. magellanicum&nbsp;</i>and <i>S. fuscum</i>. The cutover areas surrounding the bog have become dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>The lake at the south of the bog is surrounded by the Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) and the Bulrush (<i>Typha latifolia</i>).</p><p>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting around the edge of the high bog, and the drainage associated with this. Large portions of the bog have been burnt in the past. These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability. There is an area of dumping at the south of the site (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Cloonoolish Bog, Co. Galway, NPWS Site Code:  000249</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Cloonoolish Bog is situated about 4 km north-east of Killimor in Co. Galway.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Cloonoolish Bog is a small example of a raised bog, but it has a high dome and good bog moss (Sphagnum spp.) cover.  It is bordered closely on its north-western side by a mineral ridge, and by low-lying agricultural ground on the other sides.  The side of the bog bounding the mineral ridge does not appear to have been cut in the past and so may form a semi-natural margin.  Overall, the bog surface is quite dry due to drainage and peat-cutting at the margins.  There are, however, wet areas with some poorly developed hummock/hollow systems, occasional small pools and one small quaking area.  There are three small ridges with unusual vegetation found at the north-east of the site.  The cutover areas have mostly been abandoned, but some have been reclaimed for agriculture.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog at Cloonoolish possesses many of the species typical of raised bogs in Ireland.  Most of the bog surface is uniformly medium wet with a high cover of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and bog mosses, with species such as <i>Sphagnum austinii, S. magellanicum, S. papillosum </i>and<i> S. cuspidatum</i>.  The eastern half has not been burnt for many years and bushy Ling Heather and lichen (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) growth predominate.  The western half has been recently burnt, and Ling Heather and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) are vigorously regrowing.  The bog moss cover appears to be equally actively regenerating.  The small wettest area, north of the centre, appears to be drying out, with deep hollows and no standing water between the hummocks.  Three interesting ridges occur, supporting Common Reed (Phragmites australis), large tufts of Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), bog mosses and many young Scot’s Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) trees.  An interesting, but very small, feature is a flush consisting of a hollow filled with Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, adjacent to a very large relic hummock with Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>).  This is surrounded by an unusual occurrence of a number of orchid species (<i>Dactylorhiza</i> spp.) over a few square metres.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting around much of the eastern and southern edges of the high bog, and the drainage associated with this.  Large portions of the bog have been severely burnt in the past.  Significant areas of cutover bog have been drained, cleared and reclaimed for agricultural purposes.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is bounded in the south by the road between Breedoge and Ballybaun crossroads.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>This site is the remnant of a larger bog that that has now been cutover and reclaimed for agriculture.  The site was formerly linked with Bella Bridge Bog NHA (591) but is now separated by an area of cutover.  A mineral ridge is found in the east of the site.  The hummocks on the bog are quite small as are the pools.  A hollow in the east side of the bog contains a flush.  Cutover is found mostly in the northern half of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a North-Western Raised bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> sp.), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), and the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i>.  There is good bog moss (Sphagnum spp.) cover on the bog.  The hummock-forming bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i> have been recorded on the site as have the relatively scarce <i>S. austinii</i> and <i>S. fuscum</i>.  Only small pools are still present on the bog and they contain the aquatic bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>).  There is a flush containing Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) and Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) in a hollow on the east side of the bog.  Bog-myrtle is also found scattered throughout the rest of the bog.  A section of old cutover in the south of the site has a dense area of scrub.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting and agriculture.  Mechanised peat-cutting is taking place mostly in the east and south-west of the site.  Areas of cutover all around the bog have been reclaimed for agriculture but there are only a few fields of improved grassland within the site.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is bounded in the north by a local road running from Dromod to Lough Rinn and in the south by a local road running from Roosky towards Lough Rinn.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>This site is the remnant of a larger bog that is now cutover and reclaimed for agriculture, the original bog has also been split up by a network of roads.  This bog is split by a mineral ridge, which is a general feature of the local landscape with long mineral ridges running between areas of raised bog.  Another interesting feature of the locality is that the bedrock under the peat is sandstone and shale.  There are areas of hummocks throughout the high bog and pools in the centre and north of the site.  There is an in-filling lake in the north of the site and a flush just south of the lake.  Cutover is found mostly in the north and south-east of this site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Northern Midland Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>.  The hummock forming bog moss <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> is common in the centre of the high bog and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> was also recorded here.  The hummock forming bog moss <i>S. austinii&nbsp;</i>has also been recorded on the bog.  Bog mosses (Sphagnum sp.) form a spongy mat in places but due to past damage from drying out and burning they are rarely present as carpets or large hummocks.  There are pools in the centre of the high bog containing the aquatic bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>, Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) and Brown Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>).  Ling Heather, Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> sp.) and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) are abundant between the pools.  The presence of dead bog moss hummocks and dried pools provide evidence of recent burning in the centre and north-east of the bog; Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) is abundant in some areas that have been burnt.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Gubagraffy Lough in the north of the site is infilling, with Common Club-rush (<i>Scirpus lacustris</i>), Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Pondweed (<i>Potamogeton</i> sp.) found around the lake.  Most of the lake is infilled with Bulrush (<i>Typha latifolia</i>), Lesser Water-parsnip (<i>Berula erecta</i>) and Yellow Iris (<i>Iris pseudacorus</i>).  To the south of the lake is a Purple Moor-grass dominated flush with Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) and Early-purple Orchid (<i>Orchis masculata</i>).  There are tracks running through the high bog which are covered in Gorse (<i>Ulex</i> sp.) and Birch (<i>Betula</i> sp.) scrub.  On the south-west tip of the high bog there is conifer encroachment on a dry burnt area.  A small birch wood is present in the west of the site on an area of old cutover and on old cutover in the south of the site there is a dense area of Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>).  Most of the cutover on the east of the site has been reclaimed for agriculture and is now improved grassland.</p><p>The internationally important species Greenland White-fronted Goose has been recorded on this site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting and agriculture.  Mechanised peat-cutting is taking place in the south-east and north of the site.  Cutover on the eastern side of the site has been reclaimed for agriculture with many fields of improved grassland.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  Regular burning on the high bog has caused the most damage to this bog.  All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  Dumping is taking place along the tracks on this site (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Crit Island Bog, Co. Galway, NPWS Site Code:  000254</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Crit Island Bog is situated approximately 4 km south-west of Ahascragh in County Galway.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The northern margin of the site is bounded by a road, while the other margins are bounded by areas of cutover and grassland.<br /></p><p>The high bog consists of two main sections.  The larger section, at the north, is elongated and very complex in shape.  There are large areas of cutover and forestry associated with it.  The southern section is smaller and rectangular in shape, with a large area of coniferous forestry on the high bog.  On the northern section there is an area with permanent pools and hummocks/hollows at the western side of the high bog.  At the extreme north-west of the site there is a block of rectangular wet semi-natural fields which are situated on the high bog.  They are in existence at least since the beginning of the 19th century.  There is a flush (Crit Lough) at the centre of the site.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog vegetation at this site is typical of a raised bog, with species such as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.) and bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.).  For ease of description the bog has been divided into 3 areas: the wettest and mostly western section, the central and north-eastern section and the separated southern section.  An area of about 20 ha of active bog has been recorded at the western section of the site with hummocks/hollows and pools.  In this area, the hummocks are principally composed of bog mosses such as <i>Sphagnum fuscum, S. papillosum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i>, and the pools are largely <i>S. cuspidatum&nbsp;</i>filled, with <i>S. magellanicum</i> lawns in between.  Further east, the hollows become smaller and the pools drier, indicating a lowering of the water level.  Much of the rest of this western area is wet, but with Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) becoming dominant.  In areas which have not been burned, there is abundant lichen (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) cover which suppresses the bog moss growth.  There is also an area of semi-natural wet grassland on the high bog at the extreme north-west of the high bog.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The north-eastern section of this bog is of poor quality, having little in the way of bog moss cover.  Instead, it is dominated by Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), Bog Asphodel and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>).  A number of long, narrow tear-pools which are bog moss-filled and aligned east-west are present east of Crit Lough.  Crit Lough is found at the centre of the site and consists of a flush which has been severely damaged by an old drain which flows south and also by the new drains.  Abundant Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) occurs on the drying surface of a bog moss carpet.

Photo: Google Street View.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Daingean Bog, Co. Offaly 002033</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Daingean Bog NHA is located approximately 3 km south-west of Daingean in Co. Offaly.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The northern and southern margins of the site are bounded by roads, and agricultural fields form most of the boundaries at the east and west of the site.</p><p>The site consists of two main lobes.  The northern lobe is much larger than the southern one and forms the majority of the high bog in the site.  The lobes are separated by a drain running through a narrow, low-lying section between them.  The cutover areas surrounding the site have, for the most part, been reclaimed for agriculture.  The bog is of particular interest as it is one of the most easterly remaining raised bogs in the country. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog vegetation is typical of the Midland Raised Bog type, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) and bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.).  Other plants include Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>).  The bog moss cover is low and consists mainly of species such as <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i>.  On the cutover, some areas have been colonised by Gorse (<i>Ulex</i> spp.) and Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>).  The Common Spotted-orchid (<i>Dactylorhiza fuchsii</i>) can be found beside some pools on the cutover.  These pools are vegetated by Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Bottle Sedge (<i>Carex rostrata</i>) and the bog moss Sphagnum papillosum.  The drained low-lying section of the southern lobe is dominated by Gorse and Willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.), with a ground flora including Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Bramble (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i> agg.), Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Silverweed (<i>Potentilla anserina</i>), Meadowsweet (<i>Filipendula ulmaria</i>) and Yorkshire-fog (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>).</p><p>The site is host to a population of Irish Hare, a species listed in the Irish Red Data Book.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of a small coniferous plantation on cutover at the south-easterly margin of the high bog.  Most of the cutover areas around the bog have been reclaimed for agriculture.  Drainage associated with these activities and with old areas of peat-cutting, are severely drying out the bog, and have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Daingean Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  It is especially important because of its eastern location, at the extreme of the range of raised bogs in Ireland (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Galway.  It can be accessed from the Mount Bellew-Dunmore road (R328).  The site consists of two main habitats raised bog and fen.  The raised bog includes both areas of high bog and cutover.  The fen occurs on the in-filled lake called Derrin Lough to the north of the site.  There is wet woodland encroaching into the fen and scrub occurs on the old cutover.  The site is bounded by agricultural grassland and an esker ridge borders the site to the north.</p><p>There are two lobes of high bog present separated by an esker ridge.  The high bog has been damaged by drainage and afforestation with forestry planted on both lobes and adjacent cutover to the north of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog mainly dominated by Bog Cottons (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.) and Deer grass (<i>Scirpus caespitosus</i>).  The surface is quite wet and hummocks of bog moss (<i>Sphagnum capifollium</i>) are present but not abundant and Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) is quite sparse.  There is no sign of burning with lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) quite abundant.  Old relic hummocks are present with the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i>. There are a few algal pools present with some bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>.  A number of small flushes with Common reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) and Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) occur on the bog surface.  In the south-west there is a flush on the slope from the high bog dominated by Rushes (<i>Juncus</i> spp.), Common Reed, Purple Moor-grass and Bog Myrtle with Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) also present.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Former conifer plantations on the high bog and cutover consist of Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta) and Sitka Spruce (<i>Picea sitchensis</i>) (see below).  There is extensive cutover to the south where active peat-cutting occurs.  In the western region of the site there is old cutover dominated by Purple Moor-grass and Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>).  Ling heather and regenerating bog mosses also occur here.  Along the margin between the high bog and the stream there is a flush of Common Reed and Purple Moor-grass.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The fen occurs on the infilled lake called Derrin Lough and is dominated by Purple Moor-grass, Common Reed, Meadowsweet (<i>Filipendula ulmaria</i>) and Bog Myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).  The surface is very wet and quaking with some Saw Sedge (<i>Cladium mariscus</i>) dominating towards the centre.  Hummocks of the bog moss <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> are present, with the mosses <i>Calliergon cuspidatum </i>and<i> Polytricum commune</i>.  There is a nice transition between the high bog and fen with seepage from the high bog down a steep slope dominated by large Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>E. vaginatum</i>) and Ling Heather over bog mosses. There is Birch (<i>Betula</i> spp.) woodland encroaching into the fen.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Other habitats present include old cutover, Birch and Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub, wet Birch woodland and streams.  Red Grouse, a bird that is declining in numbers, occur on this site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Past landuse on the site comprise active peat-cutting and forestry which has now been clear felled (see below).  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning of the high bog.  There are also conifer seedlings encroaching onto the high bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Derrinlough Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This site supports a diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummock/hollow complexes, as well as a number of scarce plant species.

Photo: Google Street View.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Derrycanan Bog, Co. Roscommon, NPWS Site Code:  000605</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Derrycanan Bog is located 8 km north-east of Roscommon town in County Roscommon.  The site comprises a relatively large raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The northern, western and eastern boundaries are bounded by trackways and those to the south by a stream.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog habitat consists of a large dome of high bog divided into three sections by a trackway and a road.  The high bog is flat with slopes associated with central drains and along the bog margins.  The fragmented nature of the high bog has led to the overall desiccation of this habitat.  Tear pools are present on the high bog and there is a large flush, possibly due to secondary wetting, in the north-east of the site.  A smaller flush occurs in the southern section with associated swallow holes.  Cutover bog occurs around all the margins of the high bog and there is regenerating cutover present either side of the central trackway.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the Midland Raised Bog type, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.) and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex</i> <i>panicea</i>).  Bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) form lawns, with <i>S. capillifolium, S. papillosum </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i> occurring commonly.  Other species present on the high bog include White Beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>).  The high bog supports the relatively scarce hummock-forming bog mosses <i>Sphagnum fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i>.  Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) are also found on the site.  Tear pools in the southern part of the high bog  are in-filling with bog mosses such as<i> Sphagnum papillosum</i>, along with Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>).  Lichen cover is good on the high bog with <i>Cladonia portentosa</i> being particularly abundant.  The large northern flush is dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) along with Bog Asphodel and Common Cottongrass and an abundance of bog mosses and the moss <i>Polytrichum commune</i>.  A series of swallow-holes occur in association with the small flush in the southern section, and here a lush growth of Ling Heather, Common Cottongrass, bog mosses and lichens is found.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is extensive cutover to the east which is dominated by Purple Moor-grass and Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) scrub.  Old cutover to the north supports birch scrub Ling Heather and Purple Moor-grass, and is separated from agricultural land by a small birch wood.  To the south-west small areas of old cutover dominated by Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) occur.  The cutaway in the centre of the bog is actively regenerating and here bog mosses, Common Cottongrass, White Beak-sedge and Bulrush (<i>Typha latifolia</i>) occur.</p><p>Red Grouse, a species that is becoming increasingly rare in Ireland, has been recorded on the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting and agriculture, and coniferous forestry occurs to the south-east of the site.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning.  The bog has been extensively drained, mainly in association with trackways, and while the site has been damaged by fire the vegetation has recovered well.  There has been extensive reclamation to agriculture grassland in the east.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Derrynagran Bog and Esker, Co. Galway, NPWS Site Code:  001255</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Derrynagran Bog and Esker is a small site situated 5km north of Moylough in east Co. Galway.  This is a raised bog habitat with areas of high bog and cutover.<br /></p><p>The high bog consists of one small very wet dome closely associated with two esker ridges to the south-west, one of which protrudes into the dome of the bog.  The esker ridge supports species rich calcareous grassland and there is some scrub and deciduous woodland development in places.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of Western Midland Raised Bog with Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) with very little, scattered Ling heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>). The high bog supports a notable variety of bog mosses (Sphagnum spp.) with <i>S. magellanicum </i>and<i>  S. papillosum</i> present.  The central area is very flat and somewhat quaking and supports a distinctive system of hummocks and pools with carpets of bog moss (especially <i>S. magellanicum</i>) extending from the edges.  Some of these pools have large, actively-growing hummocks of the scarce bog moss, <i>S. austinii</i> particularly on islands which have escaped any fire damage.  Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxyccocos</i>) occurs amongst the bog moss cover in places, indicating flush conditions. The scarce and localised plant Brown Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>) is abundant in some of the pools.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The main area of cutover occurs to the east, this is a complex of banks and abandoned very wet cutover with regenerating bog mosses and Cottongrass.  The lowland dry grassland on the steep-sided esker ridges is species-rich with abundant lime-loving plants such as Mountain Everlasting (<i>Antennaria dioica</i>) and Spring-sedge (<i>Carex caryophyllea</i>), Carline Thistle (<i>Carlina vulgaris</i>), Wild Thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), Glaucous Sedge (<i>Carex flacca</i>) and many others.  Several spikes of the Early Purple Orchid (<i>Orchis mascula</i>) are also present.  The sward is very closely grazed with 100% cover.  In many places Ling Heather occurs indicating less calcareous soil.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Dry, semi-natural woodland occurs on some of the slopes of the eskers, consisting mainly of Hazel (<i>Corylus avellana</i>), with some Ash (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) and the occasional large Oak tree (Quercus sp.).  The ground flora is diverse where not trampled by stock.  In the south-west corner a small turlough-like pond with a stony shore occurs in a steep-sided amphitheatre of eskers.  Part of the esker ridge is heavily improved grassland, but it is included to preserve the hydrology of the site.  In a zone between the bog and the eskers there is a species-rich flooded fen grassland with low-growing sedge species such as Yellow Sedge (<i>Carex flava</i> agg).  This is a possible remnant of a lagg zone which naturally surround raised bogs and are now very rare due to drainage and turf cutting.</p><p>Red Grouse, a species that is becoming increasingly rare in Ireland has been recorded on the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of mechanical peat-cutting along the north-west margins. Grazing activities along the margins between esker and bog has lead to poaching damage in this area.  Damaging activities associated with this landuse include drainage and burning.  Fire damage has been recorded in the 1980s and more recently in a small section along the bog margins  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Clare, NPWS Site Code:  000337</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Doon Lough Bog is situated approximately 3 km north-east of Broadford, Co. Clare.  The site comprises a raised bog, that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog, woodlands, lakes, marsh, fen and wet meadows.  The site is bounded by  roads to the west, south and east.  The high bog is bounded by mineral ridges to the west and east and wet grassland to the south.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog on the site consists of a small, relatively intact basin bog with a distinct dome.  Towards the centre there is a hummock/hollow complex.  Cutover is found all around the high bog and includes areas of regenerating cutover bog, humid grassland and Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens)</i> scrub.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog, with such species as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> <i>angustifolium</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus</i> <i>cespitosus</i>) and Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>).  Bog mosses present include the hummock-formers <i>Sphagnum austinii, S. fuscum, S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i>, as well as <i>S. cuspidatum</i> which is found in hollows.  Many of the hollows are colonised by algae.  Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), a midlands raised bog indicator species is also found on the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The cutover supports a range of habitats including regenerating cutover, birch scrub, wet grasslands and areas of old peat cutting.  The cutover is mostly abandoned and there has been some scrub encroachment in a few areas.  There is excellent regeneration of the cutover, with bog moss cover in places up to 80% and including an abundance of hummocks of <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>and<i> S. capillifolium</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site also includes a large lake system with a variety of fringing habitats, which include scrub, woodland, marsh, and wet grassland.  The emergent vegetation is usually confined to the more sheltered extensions of the lake with Common Reed (Phragmites australis) and Bulrush (<i>Typha latifolia</i>) locally abundant.  Birch and willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.) woodland and scrub occur in areas close to the lake edge.  Similarly wooded islands are present on the lake.  Mixed woodland forms a large portion of the site particularly to the east of Doon Lough.  Much of the woodland is located on sloping ground with a distinct change from deciduous trees to conifers further upslope.  On the lower ground mature Sessile Oak (<i>Quercus petraea</i>) dominates, along with Ash (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) and to a lesser extent Mountain Ash (<i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>).  Beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>) and Sycamore (<i>Acer pseudoplantanus</i>) occur regularly.  Further upslope Scot’s Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) and Norway Spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) occur in large stands between distinct bands of deciduous trees.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site includes angling, amenity use, peat cutting and agriculture.  There has been active peat-cutting around the raised bog in the recent past but it is very limited.  Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes to the south, east and north of the site in the past. Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>), an invasive species, grows on parts of the bog.  Damaging activities associated with peat-cutting and agricultural reclamation include drainage and burning of the high bog.  These are activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Eskerboy Bog, Co. Galway, NPWS Site Code:  001264</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Eskerboy Bog is situated approximately 4 km north-west of Killimor, Co. Galway.  The site comprises a long, narrow raised bog with areas of high bog and cutover, which lies between two esker ridges.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The site has a typical raised bog topography with a small, low domed area in the bog centre, with infilling pools.  Three flushes occur, one along the southern margin of the high bog the other two towards the central area.  Habitat diversity is increased with the presence of Downy Birch (Betula pubescens) scrub, in association with the central flush.  Narrow bands of abandoned cutover occur along the southern and northern bog margins.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This is a typical example of the Western/Midland Raised Bog Type, with vegetation consisting of Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-Tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>).  Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) has been recorded from the site.  The central area of the high bog has pools infilling with Hare’s-Tail Cottongrass and there is a good cover of bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum magellanicum, S. capillifolium, S. auriculatum </i>and<i> S. fuscum</i>).  Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) and Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) are found in association with the two small flush areas to the south and centre of the site.  The larger flush to the centre of the high bog supports a small grove of scattered Downy Birch.  Abandoned cutover areas are dominated by Gorse to the north, with abundant Purple Moor-grass in the southern cutover margins.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site comprises peat-cutting on the eastern and western sides.  There has been very limited peat-cutting to the north and south, where a narrow band of cutover separates the high bog from adjoining esker ridges.  To the south-east and north-east the cutaway has been reclaimed for agriculture.  Damaging activities associated with this landuse include drainage and burning.  Drainage has led to drying out of the bog surface; however, no recent drains are evident on the site.  Fire damage was recorded in the 1980s and 1990s – this has led to an abundance of Bog Asphodel.  However, the presence of bog mosses and regenerating Ling Heather indicates recovery of the bog surface in some areas.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Forthill Bog, Co. Longford, NPWS Site Code:  001448</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Forthill Bog is located 2 km from the north-eastern shore of Lough Ree and 2 km south-east of Newtown Cashel in Co. Longford.  It is one of only two raised bogs in this region that have not been developed for commercial peat extraction.  This bog is 4 km south-west of the Ballymahon to Lanesbourogh road (R392) and can be accessed from local roads to the south-east and bog tracks to the west and north-west of the site.  It is bounded by mineral soil to the east, improved grassland and cutover to the west and Birch scrub on cutover to the north.<br /></p><p>The site consists of a small raised bog with a single dome of high bog and associated cutover.  The main features of interest are the pools, flushes and wetter areas of the high bog.  Towards the north-east of the high bog, there is a good though somewhat limited pool system and a small flush is present to the south-east.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, dominated by Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus caespitosus</i>) with Cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos).  Overall the high bog surface is quite wet and although bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) are not very abundant, there is regeneration over most of the high bog.  The dried out marginal areas to the south and south-west have little moss cover and are dominated by Ling Heather, Bog Asphodel and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) with some Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>).  There is some cracking and subsidence here with associated tear pools.  Towards the north-eastern section of the high bog, there is a small pool system with some pools containing bog moss (<i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>) and Sundew (<i>Drosera</i> spp.).  Between the pools, bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum austinii, S magellanicum, S. capillifolum </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i>) are more dominant and the rare bog moss <i>S. fuscum</i> is also present.  A small flush occurs in the south-east around an in-filling lake, which has wet habitat of bog moss (<i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>), Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Cranberry and Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>).  The bog surface is slightly quaking around this lake.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is extensive cutover present on this site, especially to the south and west.  This is dominated by Purple Moor-grass, Ling Heather and Soft Rush.  The cutover to the north-west is dominated by Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) and Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) scrub.  Along the eastern margin, there is a flushed area on a transition between the high bog and mineral soil.  Purple Moor-grass dominates with Creeping Bent-grass (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>) and large clumps of Bog Myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).  This area has dried out due to drainage and Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) is sparse.  This may be the remnant of a lagg zone between the bog and the surrounding mineral soil.  The ditches on the eastern and north-western boundaries are on mineral soil and contain Bulrush (<i>Typha latifola</i>), Pondweeds (<i>Potomogeton</i> spp.) and other aquatic plants, which reveal the groundwater influence in these locations.  There is also Birch (<i>Betula</i> spp.) scrub on cutover to the north, with Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) and Bramable (<i>Rubus fruiticosus</i> agg.) dominating the ground layer.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of agricultural reclamation of old cutover and mechanical peat-cutting.  Damaging activities associated with these include poaching, drainage and burning with large portions of the bog being burnt at regular intervals.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  Dumping of household rubbish and agricultural waste has also been noted on this site (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Patrick Crushell.&nbsp;</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Nore Valley Bogs, Co. Tipperary, NPWS Site Code:  001853</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Nore Valley Bogs is situated in the Nore Valley approximately 8 km south-east of Roscrea in Co. Tipperary.  The site consists of an area of raised bog, including areas of high bog and cutover, divided in two by a road and adjoining the channelled River Nore.  The dome of the western high bog features a pool/hummock complex and some flush systems.  Cutover is found all around the margins and active peat cutting occurs on the east, north-east, north and north-west margins.  There is also a stand of woodland on the boundary with the River Nore.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog.  Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>), Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium </i>and <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) are the dominant plants, with Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), occasional Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) also present.  The pool/hummock complex vegetation consists of Cottongrass, Ling Heather and bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. magellanicum </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i>).  The pools contain the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> and are infilling with Cottongrass.  Bog-rosemary and Cranberry are found growing on hummocks here.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There are three flushes on the bog, two of which supports Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>).  The understorey is mainly Downey Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), while the ground flora is dominated by Ling Heather, Cranberry, Bog-rosemary, Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>) and a range of mosses.  The third flush is located on the southern margin of the bog and is dominated by Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) with Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>).  The active cutover is mainly bare peat, while old cutaway is dominated by Purple Moor-grass with Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub. </p><p>Areas of woodland fringe the river on the northern bank.  There are also small areas of scrub and woodland to the south and the west of the site.</p><p>Hen Harrier, Hare, Badger and Otter, which are all listed as Red Data Book species have been recorded for this site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is extensive commercial peat cutting to the east and north-west of this site and numerous drains extend into the bog and its surrounding cutaway.  Burning has recently damaged the bog and the surface is hard in places.  There is a small stand of Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) on the north-east of the site and some agricultural reclamation of cutaway in the south-west.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Irish Peatland Conservation Council.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Girley Bog, Co. Meath 001580</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Girley Bog NHA is located 7 km south-west of Kells in Co. Meath.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog, and is bounded in parts by coniferous forestry to the south and north.  The site is partially divided by a large drain that runs across the high bog.  There is an area of hummocks and pools in the southern half of the high bog, although parts of the south-west have been afforested.  Cutover is found all around this site and in the north-west and south-west the cutover has been utilised for forestry.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>).  Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and the lichen <i>Cladonia portentosa</i> are common on areas of the high bog.  The bog mosses <i>Sphagnum papillosum, S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i> are common in the centre and south-west of the high bog and the scarce bog moss <i>S. fuscum</i> is found at the centre of the site.  The bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> is found in the pools at the centre of the bog and is also found in the tear pools in the north-west of the site in association with Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>).  The bog moss <i>S. magellanicum</i> and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) are found growing on the edges of these tear pools.  Young Lodgepole Pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) and Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) are frequently encroaching on the high bog in the north-west and south-east of the site.  In the south-west of the high bog there is coniferous forestry plantation.  The cutover on the western half of the site is also dominated by coniferous forestry.  The remainder of the cutover is dominated by Ling Heather and Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) scrub.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Past landuse on the site included forestry, both on the high bog and on the cutover which has now been clear felled (see below).  There has been burning on the north-west of the high bog in the past.  There is active peat-cutting in the north-west and south-east of the site.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  There are major drains running through the centre of the high bog.  All these activities have resulted in loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Girley Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummocks and pools.  This site is one of the few remaining raised bogs in County Meath and represents the eastern extreme of the range of raised bogs in the country (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work to clear a conifer plantation from the surface of the bog and block ditches has been undertaken by <b>Coillte LIFE </b>(see below) and <b>NPWS</b>.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland (LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>This site is open to the public and includes visitor information signs and a boardwalk and loop walking track around the bog. <a href='http://www.ipcc.ie/discover-and-learn/ipccs-peatland-nature-reserves/girley-bog-co-meath-visitor-map-and-guide/' target='_blank'>IPCC Visitor information</a>.</u><br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Google Street View.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Hawkswood Bog, Co. Offaly 002355</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Hawkswood bog is located 5 km south of Tullamore in Co. Offaly.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog and adjoins Clonard Wood NHA (574) to the west.  It can be accessed from the local road to the south of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This raised bog is at the southern extreme of the range of raised bogs in Ireland and is in close proximity to Screggan Bog NHA (921) and Pallis Lough NHA (916).  The high bog has pools present and is still wet and quaking in places with very little drainage and no forestry.  The wet areas occur in depressions on the high bog, causing re-wetting of the bog surface.  Cutover is found all around the high bog margins.  There are esker ridges with broadleaved woodland to the south and north of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, dominated by abundant White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) with Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorium vaginatum</i>), Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>).  There are some wet algal hollows present.  Hummocks of the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum papillosum, S. magellanicum </i>and<i> S. subniten</i>s occur and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifola</i>) is also present.  The abundance of <i>Rhynchospora alba</i> may be an indication of lowering water levels and recent burning.  This is also indicated by the presence of Bog Asphodel hollows and small Ling Heather, which is slower to recover from fire than Cross-leaved Heath and so is not as dominant.  Lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) are scarce on the bog due to this burning.  Some small scattered hummocks of the bog moss <i>S. austinii</i> with the liverwort <i>Odontoschisma sphagni </i>are regenerating.  There are some good pools with <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> but these are becomming algal.  Dead, burnt hummocks are being colonised by the moss <i>Campylopus introflexus</i>.  Towards the centre of the high bog there are larger hummocks (2 m in diameter) of the bog moss <i>S. austinii&nbsp;</i>overgrown with Cross-leaved Heath.  An old burn-line is present on the high bog to the east of the site.  The eastern high bog has recovered from an older burn with dead hummocks still present.  Ling Heather and Cottongrasses dominate with Lichens, abundant Bog Asphodel and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) locally abundant.  The lichen (<i>Cladonia floerkiana</i>) is also present, which along with the moss <i>Campylopus introflexus</i> is indicitative of burning.  There are very few living bog moss hummocks.  White Beak-sedge is also locally abundant.</p><p style='outline: none;'>To the north of the high bog, there is a very wet area with frequent pools.  These are mostly algal, but some are filled with bog moss (<i>S. cuspidatum</i>).  Between the pools White Beak-sedge, Cross-leaved Heath, Cottongrasses and Ling Heather dominate.  This area is very wet and slightly quaking with extensive lawns of the bog moss <i>S. magellanicum</i>.  There is also abundant Bog-rosemary present.  There is a lot of surface water present.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This area adjoins a wet flush of Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) with Cottongrasses and Ling Heather present.  There is some Birch (<i>Betula</i> spp) and Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) encroaching on the high bog.  This area is slightly quaking with White Beak-sedge hollows.  There is abundant bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> along with the moss <i>Polytrichum</i> <i>commune</i>.  There are few hummocks here but extensive Sphagnum lawns.  This flush of Common Reed and Birch is probably occurring on shallow peat.  Old peat-cutting to the north is dominated by Bracken and Gorse.  A small area of reclaimed grassland occurs between the high bog and the wooded esker ridge to the south. This ridge has mature woodland of Oak (Quercus spp.) and Beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>).  A smaller ridge with woodland (Hawkswood) occurs to the north of the site.</p><p>Numerous Snipe have been recorded on the bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting, agriculture and forestry.  There appears to be very little peat-cutting, with only limited domestic peat-cutting to the south and south-west, but otherwise there is little damaging operations.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include burning of the high bog and drainage at the bog margins.  These activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Hawkswood Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummocks, lawns and pools.  Its southern location adds further interest (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog. The site is bounded by a road in the east, with agricultural grassland and commercial forestry to the north, west and south.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Keeloges Bog NHA has an extensive area of hummocks and pools and is wet and quaking in areas. There is a flush in the west of the site. Coniferous forestry is found on three small sections of the high bog and associated cutover in the north, west and south-west of the site. Old cutover is found all around the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This bog has been classified as a Western Raised Bog with Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), abundant Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifoilum</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) and the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i>. In the middle of the high bog stretching east towards the road there is a well developed system of hummocks and pools. The bog mosses <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. denticulatum</i> are found in the pools as is Round-leaved Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>). The areas between the pools are wet and quaking and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>), and Cottongrasses are common. The hummock forming bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. papillosum, </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> and the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i> were also recorded between the pools. The south-west of the bog has a shallow peat layer and is dryer with Ling Heather dominant.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) dominated flush in the west of the site is drained by a channel. Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>), Bottle Sedge (<i>Carex rostrata</i>), Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Marsh Violet (<i>Viola palustris</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum fallax</i> were recorded in the area of the channel. Coniferous forestry is found on three small sections of the high bog and associated cutover in the north, west and south-west of the site. Also in the south-west of the site there is a small area of Gorse (<i>Ulex</i> sp.) scrub on the high bog. In the north-east of the site there is an area of scrub on the cutover.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include recent peat-cutting, forestry and agriculture. Peat-cutting has occurred all around the site but recent peat-cutting is now mostly in the southeast of the site. Extensive recent cutting has taken place on the high bog that occurs to the east of the site. Since the 1970s conifers have been planted on three small sections of the high bog and cutover in the north, west and south-west of the site (see below). The reclaiming of cutover for agriculture has occurred around the site. Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and extensive burning of the high bog. A network of drainage ditches in preparation for forestry was inserted in western parts of the high bog. These activities listed have all resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Keeloges Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.

Galway, NPWS Site Code:  001280</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Killaclogher Bog is situated about 5 km north-east of Monivea in Co. Galway.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog, and an in-filled lake.  It is bordered along its eastern side by the Killaclogher River, and on the western side by a small stream.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Killaclogher Bog consists of four main lobes, separated from each other by a network of tracks and areas of cutover peat.  There are wet areas with some pools in the most southern lobe of the site, but for the most part the bog is uniform with only shallow hollows, which are often filled with algae.  A small stream rises at the pool area and flows north-westwards a short distance before it flows into the cutover.  Another larger stream exists between the most southern lobe and the one above it, which drains from the bog into the Killaclogher River.  A number of interesting flushes occur on the cutover areas at the west of the site.  These appear to be linked to the in-filled lake to the north.  Some of the cutover areas around the bog are still actively cut, but most have been abandoned or reclaimed for agriculture.  There are a number of areas of coniferous forestry at the south and north of the site.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog at Killaclogher possesses many of the species typical of Western Raised Bogs in Ireland, with species such as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), many bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>.  The wettest area occurs in the most southern lobe of the site, where pools and hummock/hollow systems are found in association with wet, spongy bog moss mats.  Species found in the pools include the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>).  Species such as Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) are frequently found on the hummocks.  The remainder of the bog is quite uniform, having been damaged by fire on a number of occasions.  The vegetation consists mainly of Ling Heather, Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Bog Asphodel, Carnation Sedge, Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Common Cottongrass.  Algal hollows are common and regenerating hummocks of the bog mosses <i>S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> can be found.  A number of flushed areas occur on the cutover at the west of the site, which may be linked to the in-filled lake to the north.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site supports an important colony of the Marsh Fritillary butterfly, a species listed on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting around many of the margins of the high bog and along the numerous tracks which cross the site, and the drainage associated with this.  Large portions of the bog have been severely burnt in the past.  Areas of cutover bog have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes, and a number of areas at the south and north of the site have been planted with coniferous forestry.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The site is surrounded by roads to the west and north and a mineral ridge to the east.<br /></p><p>The site consists of a small basin bog with a flat wet surface that is quaking in places. Towards the north-eastern end there is a large complex of pools and hollows.  Cutover occurs all around the site apart from in the south.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, with such species as cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium </i>and<i> E. vaginatum</i>), Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora</i> <i>alba</i>), Round-leaved Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>) and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>).  Midland Raised Bog indicator species found on the bog include Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>.  Toward the north-eastern end of the bog there is a large area of hummocks and pools.  Some pools are filled with the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> but most have algae, Common Cottongrass <i>(Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Brown Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>).  Intervening hummocks have the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. capillifolium</i>.  Other bog mosses found on the bog include <i>Sphagnum fuscum, S. subnitens </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i>.  Towards the south-west, the bog is dominated by Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), Bog Asphodel, Ling Heather, Deergrass, Cross-leaved Heath <i>(Erica tetralix</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum tenellum</i>.  The east of the site is bounded by a small area of birch woodland, that extends onto the mineral ridge.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of industrial peat-cutting around the north, east and south-east of the site with old peat-cuttings to the west and north-west.

Galway, NPWS Site Code:  001283</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Killure Bog is situated approximately 2 km north-west of Ballinasloe in County Galway.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The bog is bisected by a road.  The eastern margin of the site is bounded by the Bunowen River, while the west, north and south of the bog are bounded mainly by local access roads.<br /></p><p>The site consists of two sections of high bog.  The western section comprises an area of quaking bog with hummocks and pools occurring in the centre.  There is a flush on the eastern margin of the western section.  Two other flushes appear on the aerial photographs.  The eastern section has been afforested.  Cutover and drainage channels occur all around the margins of the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midlands Raised Bog.  The vegetation consists of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) frequent to abundant Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>).  The western indicator Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) occurs to the east of the western subsection.  Midland indicators present at the site include Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and the bog moss (<i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>).  Other bog mosses present include <i>Sphagnum papillosum, </i>hummock-forming <i>S. fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'>The central area of the western high bog is quaking, with large and small pools with open water and large areas of bog mosses <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i> and between the pools a wide variety of other bog mosses are present.  Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>) and Oblong-leaved Sundew (<i>D. intermedia</i>) are also present in pools.  The pools become larger and interlocking in the south-east of this area and become more like a quaking flush with large carpets of Sphagnum between pools including <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i> and vigorous <i>S. papillosum</i>.  There is an extensive flush area in the mid-east of the high bog.  It consists of scattered and sometimes dense Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting around the southern edge of the high bog and forestry.  Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.  Peat-cutting on the site has also increased in area and intensity within the last decade through the use of mechanised methods for peat extraction.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site (both old and recent) and extensive burning of the high bog.  Forestry on the high bog is reaching maturity and should be harvested soon.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Kilnaborris Bog, Co. Galway, NPWS Site Code:  000284</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Kilnaborris Bog is situated 6 km west of Eyrecourt, Co. Galway. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.<br /></p><p>The  site consists of one raised bog dome. The central area has a number of degraded pools, which have become infilled.  There are more pools north of the bog centre and a flush in the centre of the bog, both of these features appears to be associated with a bog burst.  Aligned tear pools and steep slopes associated with the bog burst are located to the south of the site. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of for both western and midlands raised bog types, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-tails Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> <i>vaginatum</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and bog moss   <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>.  Most of the other species are found in localised patches.  The bog moss <i>Sphagnum</i> <i>auriculatum</i> is found in several large hollows.  Other pools are filled with bog moss (<i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>) along with Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Long-leaved Sundew (Drosera anglica).  The bryophytes <i>Sphagnum fuscum, Dicrananum scoparium </i>and<i> Pleurozia schreberi</i> as well as Ling Heather, Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) are found in the centre flush.   There are extensive lawns of bog moss (<i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. papillosum </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i>) in the central area of the high bog.  Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) can be found growing on dryer areas of the bog in areas where the drainage has been affected by the old bog burst.  Ling Heather is found on steep slopes and on the cutaway.  The club moss <i>Huperzia selago</i> is scattered throughout the bog vegetation.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat cutting, which is now mainly confined to the western margin.  Peat cutting and burning have led to the drying out of the bog surface.  Peat cutting was the probable cause of a major bog burst pre-1973.  There is some evidence that the bog burst has caused considerable drying out of the bog surface.  Bog bursts are relatively infrequent occurrences on a raised bog. Scots Pine is becoming established on dryer areas of the bog and on steep banks (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Leaha Bog, Co. Galway, NPWS Site Code:  000292</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Leaha Bog is located 9.5 km east-south-east of Glenamaddy in County Galway.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is bounded in the south and south-west by a tributary of the Shiven River and in the north of the site by a road.<br /></p><p>The site is part of a large bog complex that is now separated by roads and cutover that has been reclaimed for agriculture.  Leaha Bog is separated from Funshin Bog NHA (267) by a road, and a tributary of the Shiven River separates Leaha Bog from Camderry Bog NHA (240) and Clooncullaun Bog NHA (245).  Leaha Bog has a shallow dome with low hummocks throughout the bog; the site does have pools but they are colonised by algae.  In the south-west of the site there is coniferous forestry on the high bog.  Cutover is found all around the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This bog has been classified as a Western Raised Bog, and supports such species as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>.  Carnation Sedge and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) are particularly dominant.  Low hummocks of the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. austinii&nbsp;</i>occur on the site as well as, but less frequently, <i>S. fuscum, S. subnitens, S. tenellum </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i>.  There are occasional large hummocks of the moss <i>Leucobryum glaucum</i> and these are colonised, among other species, by the moss <i>Campylopus introflexus</i> and the lichens <i>Cladonia crispata, C. portentosa </i>and<i> C. floerkeana</i>.  The only pools are of a poor quality and are colonised by algae; they are mainly found in the north-west of the site and the south-west near the forestry.  Although the aquatic bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> does not dominate in the pools it has been recorded on the bog.  The short stature of the Ling Heather and the presence of only algal pools provide some evidence of burning on the bog in the past.  Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) formerly grew in a wet area in the south-west of the bog but this section of the high bog has now been planted with coniferous forestry.  The cutover in the west of the site is dominated by coniferous forestry and in the east of the site it is primarily reclaimed grassland.  Species recorded on the peaty wet grassland include Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Devil’s-bit Scabious (<i>Succisa pratensis</i>) and Green-ribbed Sedge (<i>Carex binervis</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include forestry, active peat cutting and agriculture.  There is forestry on the high bog in the south-west of the site and on the cutover along the western edge of the site.  Active peat-cutting is most prevalent along the track in the south-west of the site and all around the northern section of the high bog.  Along the eastern edge of the site the cutover has been reclaimed for agricultural grassland.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and extensive burning of the high bog.  These activities have all resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Roscommon, NPWS Site Code:  002072</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Lisnanarriagh Bog is  situated about 6 km west of Lanesborough in Co. Roscommon.  The site comprises a relatively small raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutaway.  The site margins are bounded by agricultural land, and the site lies just 1km from the boundary to Lough Ree cSAC (440) at the Clooneigh River.<br /></p><p>The high bog consists of a small dome divided in two by a track running north-west, south-east.  Mature Birch woodland occurs on cutover around much of the southern lobe.  Cutover bog surrounds the majority of the northern lobe and some  reclaimed grassland also occurs.  A small area of commercial forestry is found to the south-west.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the Western Raised Bog type, consisting of  Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>),  Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) and the liverwort (<i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>).  Other common species include Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>).  Overall the high bog surface is firm, but there is good bog moss (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) growth in places where the ground is soft and wet.   A small area of  pools occur close to the trackway (possibly tear pools).  There are some well developed hummocks of <i>Sphagnum austinii</i>.  The scarce species Brown Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>) occurs around pool edges.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Old cutaway surrounding the south-west part of the dome is dominated by an extensive area of mature wet woodland with Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>).  Other species present include Holly (<i>Ilex aquifolium</i>), Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) and Smooth Meadow-grass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>) </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting along much of the margins of the northern lobe.  A small area of afforestation has occurred on cutaway to the south.  Some land reclamation to fields has occurred on old cutaway to the east.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning.  Fire damage has been recorded in the 1980s and there is evidence of more recent burning on the high bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Ling Heather is common all over the bog as is Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>).  In addition to the commoner hummock forming bog mosses, such as <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> and <i>S. papillosum</i>, some hummocks of <i>S. austinii</i> and the moss <i>Leucobryum glaucum</i> are also found.  Bog mosses indicative of wetter conditions, such as S<i>. magellanicum </i>and<i> S. cuspidatum</i> occur in places.  There is a small Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) flush in the centre of the bog and the bog moss <i>S. recurvum </i>occurs here.  Seedlings of Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) extend on to the bog surface.  The moss <i>Campylopus introflexus </i>is common on much of the cutover around the edges of the high bog.

Photo: The Living Bog LIFE 14.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Lough Derravaragh, Co. Westmeath 000684</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Lough Derravaragh is located approximately 12 km north of Mullingar town in Co. Westmeath.  The majority of the site comprises the lake, but it also includes a variety of wetland, grassland and woodland habitats.  The site includes a small area of raised bog.  The site is bounded in the north-west by the River Inny.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The River Inny, which is a major tributary of the River Shannon, flows into and out of Lough Derravaragh at its north-west end.  At this end, the lake is wide and shallow and the raised bog and cutover is found in this area.  Lough Derravaragh is shallow and its water is hard with an alkaline pH.  There is only a small area of raised bog in the site, but formerly it comprised a very large bog complex which extended to the north-west of the lake.  Most of this has now been cutover and large areas have been reclaimed for agriculture.  The remaining area of bog has hummock/hollow complexes but no pools.  Coniferous forestry was previously planted on the high bog and a section of cutover.  Cutover is found all around the high bog and there is also a separate small area of old cutover 2.5 km south of the raised bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, with such species as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>).  The hummock-forming bog moss <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> has been recorded on the high bog as has the more scarce <i>S. austinii</i>.  Overall, Sphagnum covers around one third of the high bog area and the centre of the bog is wet with standing water in places.  The aquatic bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum </i>has been recorded in the hollows on the bog.  Ling Heather and Hare’s-tail Cottongrass are common on the hummocks as are lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> sp.).  There are dried out channels on the bog which are colonised by algae, Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and lichens.  Coniferous forestry has been planted on the western side of the high bog and on adjoining areas of cutover.  On the cutover in the south-east, south and north of the site of the site there are areas of Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) woodland, with patches of Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub in between.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>A notable feature of Lough Derravaragh is the range of Charophytes (Stoneworts) that occur in the lake; to date eight species have been recorded here, several of which have a restricted range in Ireland.  Around the lake margin, a range of habitats have been created as a result of drainage of the River Inny.  At the western end are extensive reed beds and swamps dominated by Common Reed (Phragmites australis) with scattered stands of Downy Birch and willows (<i>Salix</i> spp.).  Elsewhere, there is freshwater marsh vegetation dominated by sedges (<i>Carex</i> spp.) and often tussock-forming grasses such as Tufted Hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and fescues (<i>Festuca</i> spp.), with a range of flowering herbs including Nodding Bur-Marigold (<i>Bidens cernua</i>) and Trifid Bur-Marigold (<i>Bidens tripartita</i>).  The lakeshore is a mineral-rich substrate and several plant species of poor fen habitats occur in abundance, such as Black Bog-rush (<i>Schoenus nigricans</i>) and Long-stalked Yellow-sedge (<i>Carex lepidocarpa</i>).  Knockeyon and the other hills around the south-eastern end of the lake support deciduous woodland which is comprised mostly of native species.  Hazel (Corylus avellana), Rowan (<i>Sorbus</i> <i>aucuparia</i>), Ash (<i>Fraxinus</i> <i>excelsior</i>) and Sessile Oak (<i>Quercus petraea</i>) are abundant.  Exotic species occur occasionally, including Beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Lough Derravaragh is an important site for wintering waterfowl, and is of particular note as a site for geese, swans and diving duck.   It is a traditional haunt for the internationally important midland flock of Greenland White-fronted Geese (which also use Loughs Iron, Owel and Ennel).  This flock, whose numbers usually range between 300 and 400 birds, use the lake mainly for roosting purposes.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>This site regularly supports nationally important populations of six species, and at times is used by the internationally important population of Greenland White-fronted Geese which is based in the region.  Three of the species which occur at the site (Greenland White-fronted Geese, Whooper Swan, Golden Plover) are listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive.  The rare Charophyte <i>Chara denudata</i>, has been recorded in Lough Derravaragh and the Red Data Book species Otter and Irish Hare have also been noted from the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include active peat-cutting, agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting and leisure activities.  On the southern margins of the high bog there is a small area of active peat-cutting.  There are only a small number of agricultural fields within the site, with a few on reclaimed cutover.  There was a coniferous forestry on a small section of high bog and cutover in the past which has been clear felled (see below).  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  The lake is an important amenity for anglers, as it holds a population of Brown Trout.  Knockbody Wood is used for shooting Pheasant.  Local groups use the lake for canoeing and watersports.  Parts of the site have also been used for dumping and as an encampment.  These activities have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Lough Derravaragh NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance, including as it does, a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  The site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummocks and hollows. Lough Derravaragh itself is of importance for its aquatic flora and fauna and for its marginal wetland habitats.

                                        "description": "<p style='outline: none;'><i>Hummock and pool community on surface of a raised bog. Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Lough Garr Bog, Co. Westmeath 001812</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Lough Garr Bog NHA is located approximately 16 km north-west of Mullingar in Co. Westmeath.  The site comprises of a mosaic of habitats which include a small raised bog, marsh, wet woodland, humid grassland and dry grassland.  The site is bounded by a main road to the west and local roads to the south and east.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog on the site consists of two areas of high bog, which have been divided by a bog road.  The bog surface is relatively dry.  There is a flush located in the south-west section of the high bog and a marsh occurs to the east of the site in what was once Lough Garr lake.  Cutover is found all around the north, west and south of the site and along the bog road.  Cutover supports wet woodland, scrub and humid grassland.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, mainly dominated by Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>).  There is frequent Crossed-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosa</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and White-beaked sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>).  The bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. tenellum </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i> are also present.  The midland indicator species Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i> are also found on the bog.  There are no pools on the bog but there is a sizeable (5.5 ha) flush to the south-west of the site.  The south-eastern lobe of the high bog and adjoining cutover has been afforested.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Cutover areas of the bog support  wet grassland, dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), with Tormentil (<i>Potentilla erecta</i>), Sheep’s-fescue (<i>Festuca ovina</i>), Common Sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosa</i>), Sweet Vernal-grass (<i>Anthoxanthun odaratum</i>), Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) and Broad Buckler-fern (<i>Dryopteris dilitata</i>).  Along the south-west margin of the site there are patches of wet woodland on cutover with Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), Goat Willow (<i>Salix caprea </i>agg) and Eared Willow (<i>Salix aurita</i>).  The understorey is dominated by Bramble (<i>Rubus fructicosus</i> agg.), Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) and Purple Moor-grass.  Heathy scrub areas are dominated by Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>), Downy Birch and Ling Heather.</p><p style='outline: none;'>An area of species-rich wet marsh occurs in a very wet lagg area in the cutover located on the south-west of margin of the site.  Creeping Bent (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>) and Brown Sedge (<i>Carex disticha</i>) are the dominant species with Marsh Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla palustris</i>), Meadowsweet (<i>Filipendula ulmaria</i>), Common Valerian (<i>Valeriana officinalis</i>), Jointed Rush (<i>Juncus articulatus</i>), Water Mint (<i>Mentha aquatica</i>), Comon Marsh-bedstraw (<i>Galium palustre</i>), Soft Rush and Devil’s-bit Scabious (<i>Succisa pratensis</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>The wet marsh with floating scraw which occupies the area that was once Lough Garr, supports homogeneous vegetation which is dominated mainly by Creeping Bent, Cowbane (<i>Cicuta virosa</i>) and Bottle Sedge (<i>Carex rostrata</i>).  Other common species include Marsh Willowherb (Epilobium palustre), Water Horsetail (Equisetum fluviatile), Bulrush (<i>Typha latifolia</i>), Cuckooflower (<i>Cardamine pratensis</i>), Common Marsh-bedstraw, Marsh-marigold (Caltha palustris) and Branched Bur-reed (<i>Sparaganium erectum</i>).  Common Reed (Phragmites australis) and Yellow Iris (<i>Iris pseudocarus</i>) occasionally form small dominant patches.  Other species present include Nodding Bur-marigold (<i>Bidens cernua</i>) and Greater Spearwort (Ranunculus lingua).  There is luxuriant moss cover, which include <i>Calliergon giganteum</i> and <i>Calliergonella cuspidata</i>.  To the west of the marsh there is a slightly drier area with Devil’s-bit Scabious, Wild Angelica (<i>Angelica sylvestris</i>), Yorkshire-fog (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>), Common Valerain, Bottle Sedge, Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Water Horsetail and Common Sorrel.  This vegetation grades into the Downy Birch wet woodland by the high bog .</p><p style='outline: none;'>The transitional zone between the marsh and the high bog has an interesting vegetation composition.  Downy Birch and Eared Willow form a patchy canopy over Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i>.  Jointed Rush can be locally abundant.  Ling Heather, Devils-bit Scabious, Bogbean and Water Horsetail are also found here.  Mosses found in this habitat include <i>Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus </i>and<i> Pleurozium schreberi.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site includes forestry, peat-cutting, dumping and grazing.  There is limited peat-cutting along the bog road and most of the cutover has been abandoned.  The south-east of the site, including high bog and cutover, has been afforested.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning of the high bog.  Dumping takes place on the site, particularly by the road which runs through the centre of the bog.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Lough Garr Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.   There is an interesting transition zone between marsh and high bog on this site which supports a good range of plant species (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

                                        "description": "<p style='outline: none;'><i>High bog surface with birch scrub at Lough Kinale and Derragh Loughs. Photo: Coillte LIFE 09.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Lough Kinale and Derragh Loughs, Cos. Longford/Cavan/Westmeath 000985</u></p><p>Lough Kinale, intersecting counties Longford, Cavan and Westmeath, is dwarfed by Lough Sheelin, the eighth largest of the Republic of Ireland's lakes, which lies about 1 km to the northeast.  However with 250 ha of open water area, Lough Kinale should not be described as a small lake.  Kinale has 2 main basins, almost separated by swamp formations.  Derragh Lough is a smaller (35 ha) companion Lough to the southeast.  The lakes lie in a limestone trough. </p><p style='outline: none;'>The main input of water into Lough Kinale is from Lough Sheelin via the River Inny.  An An Foras Forbartha report from 1972 states that Lough Sheelin had become polluted by nutrient enrichment, and was characterized by blooms of blue-green algae.  The same blue green algal blooms also characterised Lough Kinale.  Environmental Research Unit data, published in 1990 indicate that by 1982 Sheelin was grossly polluted (hypertrophic) but had since recovered to a state (mesotrophic) that must be approaching its former water quality status.  It seems likely that Lough Kinale has also recovered some of its former water quality.  The residence time of water in both lakes is comparatively low, in the order of 6 months, and so water quality is likely to show dramatic response to changes in nutrient input levels.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The plant communities around the lake are of interest.  The largest area is covered by Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) and Tufted-sedge (<i>Carex elata</i>) Swamps and marshes, behind which there is often a calcium rich small sedge marsh, characterised by species such as Long-stalked Yellow-sedge (<i>Carex lepidocarpa</i>), Marsh Pimpernel (<i>Anagallis tenella</i>) and Knotted Pearlwort (<i>Sagina nodosa</i>) which are restricted to such habitats, together with wetland species which are less dependant upon calcium status, such as Marsh Pennywort (<i>Hydrocotyle vulgaris</i>), Water Mint (<i>Mentha aquatica</i>) and Red Rattle (<i>Pedicularis palustris</i>).&nbsp; </p><p style='outline: none;'>There are peatland areas adjacent to 2 sides of Lough Kinale, one bog area separating it from Derragh Lough.  These areas have suffered from the establishment of conifer plantations, which not only damages the area they occupy, but introduces fertilisers, and silt into the water on establishment, and discharges collected pollutants once established.</p><p> </p><p style='outline: none;'>The value of Lough Kinale and Derragh Lough for wildfowl is evident, with reliable, nationally important numbers of Mute Swan, Pochard and Tufted Duck recorded in the mid 1980.  There are also important numbers of Great Crested Grebe, Whooper Swan, Wigeon, Teal, Goldeneye, Coot, Golden Plover, Lapwing and Curlew.  The adjacent wetlands and peatland are of particular importance for the last 3 species. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Although the interchange of birds between sites is not properly understood, it is clear that this area is an important refuge for birds disturbed from other sites.  It has been known to carry very large numbers of birds in the past, for example in 1975 a raft of 2400 Coot was counted, and in 1969, 2,160 Tufted Duck and 2,425 Pochard were recorded in January. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Birds using Kinale and Derragh are also subject to disturbance - the lakes are intensively shot over from September to January, and although the famous trout fishery has declined through water pollution, angling for coarse fish from boats continues throughout the year.  These activities must cause some disturbance to waterbirds in the winter months, and make feeding areas unavailable. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Shooting pressure on State-owned Lough Kinale is regulated by the NPWS.  It may be necessary to adopt stricter control/regulation on shooting pressure (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</b> (LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Lough Tee Bog, Co. Galway 000307</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Lough Tee Bog NHA is located 6 km east of Monivea in Co. Galway. The site comprises a raised bog that includes areas of high bog, cutover bog, scrub, conifer forestry, humid grassland, and improved grassland.</p><p>There is a large area of hummocks and pools in the centre of the high bog which is wet and quaking. Coniferous forestry is located on high bog in the east of the site. Forestry is also present on the cutover just to the north of the site. A large area of raised bog adjoins the site to the west.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> sp.), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> and the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i>. The hummock-forming bog mosses <i>Sphagnum fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> have been recorded on the high bog. The bog mosses <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and <i>S. denticulatum</i> are found in the pools. Brown Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>) grows in some of the pools and the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> is abundant at the edges of the pools. Around this wet centre there are large areas of Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>). The bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum </i>is found in the pools and there are lawns of <i>S. magellanicum</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is coniferous forestry on the high bog in the east of the site. Forestry is also on the cutover adjoining this area and on a separate section of cutover to the north of the site. Regenerating cutover occurs in places around the bog margin it supports vegetation of Ling Heather, Purple Moor-grass, and bog mosses; <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> lawns occur in the wetter areas. The cutover in the far east of the site consists of lowland wet grassland with many sedge (<i>Carex</i> sp.) species noted.</p><p>An extensive area of high bog that has been subject to intensive peat cutting in recent years occurs to the west of the site. This area of mostly degraded bog supports flushes and two remnant bog lakes.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Golden Plover, a species that is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, and Otter, a Red Data Book species have been recorded in proximity to the site.</p><p>Current landuses on the site include forestry, recent peat-cutting, and agriculture. Forestry is found on the high bog and cutover in the east and north of the site. Peat-cutting has occurred around most of the site. Recent mechanised peat-cutting is mainly confined to the west and south of the site.</p><p>The most improved reclaimed agricultural fields are south of the high bog. Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning of the high bog. All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Lough Tee Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance, comprising as it does, a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland. The site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummocks and pools (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Loughanilloon Bog, Co. Clare 001020</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Loughanilloon Bog NHA is located 8 km east-north-east of Tulla mainly in Co. Clare.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog, the site also includes a lake.  The site is bounded in the north-east by the Cloghaun River and in the west by the main road between Broadford and Feakle.</p><p>This site includes a small area of raised bog and Lake Loughanilloon.  The raised bog was formerly found either side of the lake but now all the remaining high bog is in the east of the site.  The bog has low hummocks and a small flush in the north of the site.  The only cutover found around the high bog is in the east of the site, however there are areas of cutover on the western side of the lake.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog, with Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>).  The hummock forming bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i> have been recorded on the high bog.  Towards the centre of the bog Cottongrass becomes dominant and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) are also present.  Towards the river, in the north of the site, bog moss (<i>Sphagnum</i> sp.) cover increases to over fifty percent and Ling Heather, Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Cottongrass, Carnation Sedge and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) also dominate.  There is some evidence of burning on the high bog - the majority of the Ling Heather is quite small and lichens are largely absent.  In the north of the bog there is a small Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) flush.  Towards the northern boundary of the high bog there is a semi-natural margin from the high bog vegetation to Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) dominated grassland which in turn leads into Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub adjacent to the river.&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>&nbsp;In the south-east of the site there is an area of old hand-cut cutover that is now regenerating, this area is dominated by Cottongrass, Ling Heather, with Bulrush (<i>Typha latifolia</i>) in the ditches.  The cutover around the south and south-west of the bog is dominated by Birch (<i>Betula</i> sp.) woodland with Bramble (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i> agg.) in the understorey.  The cutover on the western side of the lake has a small area of Birch woodland but has larger areas of Birch and Willow (<i>Salix</i> sp.) scrub.  The open water of the lake is surrounded by a margin of wetland vegetation with Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) and Rushes (Juncus sp.) common.  The fields of wet grassland north of the Cloghaun River provide an important habitat for bird species.</p><p>The internationally protected bird the Whooper Swan and three Red Data Book mammals Otter, Badger and Pine Marten have been recorded at the site.</p><p>Current landuses on the site include agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting.  There are semi-improved fields all around the periphery of this site and there is evidence of cattle grazing on the high bog.  Farm slurry has been reported to be entering a drain that leads into the south of the lake. The forestry is not commercial and involves Birch being cut for fence posts.  Hunting and fishing occur where the Cloghaun River enters the lake and bird species present at the site that would be hunted include Snipe, Mallard and Pheasant.  Damaging activities associated with the agriculture include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Loughanilloon Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummocks and a flush, the presence of a lake at the site adds to its diversity (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Galway, NPWS Site Code:  000310</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Meeneen Bog is situated 6 km south-west of Eyrecourt, Co Galway.  The site comprises a medium-sized raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The River Shannon runs to the south-east of the site.<br /></p><p>This raised bog consists of a distinct dome of high bog divided into three sections by trackways.  The fragmented nature of the high bog has led to the overall desiccation of this habitat, and a lowering of the water table.  There is a large flush in the central lobe. To the north-west and south-east of the site several small areas of mixed deciduous woodland occur.  The bog is surrounded by cutover on all its margins.</p><p> </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the Midland Raised Bog type, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.), and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>).  Other common species on the high bog include Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium</i> <i>ossifragum</i>) and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus caespitosus</i>).  Bog moss (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) growth is good.  The overall topography is dominated by hummocks.  Many pools contain algae and are showing signs of drying out.  In the western lobe, good <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>hummocks occur and some pools contain <i>S. cuspidatum</i> and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>).  The sundews <i>Drosera rotundifolia </i>and<i> D. intermedia</i> also occur.  Bilberry  (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>) has been recorded from a cutface along the north-eastern margins.  An extensive flush dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerula</i>) occurs to the east of the site. Other species associated with the flush include Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinum oxycoccos</i>) and the Heath Spotted-orchid (<i>Dactylorhiza maculata</i>).  </p><p style='outline: none;'>There is extensive cutover to the north-west, south-west and south-east of the site. Downy Birch and Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) have encroached onto the cutover in many areas.  In the north-west two small areas of birch wood occur and a larger area is found on cutover in the south-west.   </p><p>Irish Hare, a Red Data Book species has been recorded on the site. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting along the south-east, south-west and north-west margins of the site. A small area of afforestation is found on cutover to the east.  Damaging activities associated with this landuse include drainage and burning. Fire damage has been recorded in the 1980s but there is little evidence of recent burning on the high bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Katharine Duff.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Milltownpass Bog, Co. Westmeath 002323</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Milltownpass Bog NHA is located 1 km north-east of Milltownpass in Co.Westmeath. The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog and can be accessed from the local road off the N6 to the east of the site.</p><p>This bog has pools present and is wet and quaking in places. The wet areas are formed by re-wetting of depressions on the high bog surface caused by subsidence. There is very little drainage on the high bog and no forestry. Cutover is found all around the high bog margins with encroaching scrub and a forestry plantation. Broad- leaved woodland occurs to the west of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorium vaginatum</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (Erica tetralix), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog- rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>). There is some encroachment by Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) at the northern high bog margin with some scattered Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>).\tIn general the high bog is wet with the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolum, S. subnitens </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i> present. Other species present include Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and the lichens <i>Cladonia portentosa, C. uncialis, C. fimbricata, C. crispidata </i>and<i> C. fleurciana</i>. The abundance of lichens is indicative of the absence of recent burning. The vegetation is quite hummocky, due to drying out and there are old dry hummocks of Ling Heather with Cranberry and the mosses <i>Dicranum majus </i>and<i> Hypnum jutlandicum</i>. The liverwort <i>Odontoschisma sphagni </i>occurs among Sphagnum hummocks.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Towards the centre of the high bog there is a dry ridge dominated by Ling Heather, Bog Asphodel and Deergrass with some Cottongrass. North of this ridge there is a wet depression dominated by Ling Heather, Cottongrasses, Cross-leaved Heath and lichens. There are small pools and wet hollows with the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> and small hummocks of the bog mosses <i>S. papillosum, S. capillifolum </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i>. Some hollows are dominated by Bog Asphodel and the hummocks are overgrown by the liverwort <i>Odontoschisma sphagni</i>. The small pools are drying out and in-filling with Cottongrass. Round-leaved Sundew (<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>) is present along with the bog moss <i>Sphagnum tenellum</i> and large lawns of <i>S. magellanicum</i>. These occur in wet quaking areas caused by re-flooding from subsidence.</p><p style='outline: none;'>South of the ridge, the high bog slopes away towards the road and grades into a very wet and quaking area that has numerous pools and extensive lawns of bog moss (<i>S. magellanicum</i>). This area is dominated by Cottongrasses and Ling Heather over</p><p style='outline: none;'>abundant Sphagnum, with Bog Asphodel and White Beak-sedge dominated hollows. Large pools occur here with the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. There are also flushed areas with the mosses <i>Aulacomnium palustre, Polytricum commune, P.alpestre, </i>the liverwort<i> Pleurozium schreberi </i>and Cranberry locally abundant.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog is surrounded by cutover, much of which has been colonised by Birch (<i>Betula</i> spp.) scrub. There is old cutover to the north, with a thin margin of Birch wood. This cutover is dominated by bog species, especially Ling Heather and lichens. There is some active peat-cutting at the north-east margin, backed by Birch scrub on cutover, and to the west some of the cutover has been reclaimed for agricultural grassland. A small forestry plantation is present on cutover to the north-east and broadleaved woodland to the west adds to the habitat diversity of the site.</p><p>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting, agriculture and forestry. To the east, outside the site, there is intensive commercial peat-cutting, but few damaging operations apart from reclamation of cutover to the west and small scale domestic peat-cutting to the east occur within the site. The heavily improved area of cutover at the western margin has been cleared of scrub, levelled and re-seeded. This reclamation directly adjoins the cutface. A new road has been built and further developments are planned. Damaging activities associated with these landuses include scrub clearance and drainage at the margins of the high bog. These activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Milltownpass Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland. This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummocks and pools and due to its easterly location, is of biogeographical importance (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Cutover is found all around the site, there is broadleaved woodland located to the south-west, wet woodland is located to the north-west, scrub to the east, humid grassland to the south, a flush/fen area to the west and humid grassland on mineral soil to the north-west.</p><p> </p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog including Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and <i>Sphagnum</i> spp..  The Midland Raised Bog indicator species Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) is also found on the bog.  Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) is found growing in a wet part of the high bog and is also invading the high bog margins from the cutover.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Active cutover bog occurs on the east and west margins of the high bog.  Scrub occurs to the north, east and south-east of the site.  Dry, broadleaved semi-natural woodland on cutover, comprising Ash (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>), Downy Birch and Willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.) with some Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus monogyna</i>) and Elder (<i>Sambucus nigra</i>) is located to the south-west of the site.  A small area of wet woodland dominated by Alder (<i>Alnus glutinosa</i>) is located to the north-west.  Wet improved grassland occurs to the south of the high bog, supporting Rushes (<i>Juncus</i> spp.), bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) and Common Cottongrass.  There is also a fen/flush area to the south-east margin of the site on cutover.  Species found here include Marsh Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla palustris</i>), Common Marsh-bedstraw (<i>Galium palustre</i>), Ragged Robin (<i>Lychnis flos-cuculi</i>), Sedges (<i>Carex</i> spp.), Marsh Pennywort (<i>Hydrocotyle vulgaris</i>) and several orchids, including Common Twayblade (<i>Listera ovata</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site includes extensive active peat-cutting on the east and western margins, with old peat-cuttings all around the site.

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Monaincha Bog/Ballaghmore Bog, Cos. Tipperary/Laois 000652</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Monaincha Bog/Ballaghmore Bog NHA is situated about 6 km east of Roscrea in Co. Laois.  The site comprises a large raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutaway. The site margins are bounded by agricultural land apart from in the south where commercial forestry occurs.  The site lies directly north of the Nore Valley Bogs NHA (1853).  </p><p>The high bog consists of a large dome with two lobes separated by forestry, a small lake and cutover.  The site supports a series of small lakes, Butlers Lough, Black Lough and Forked Lough.  Commercial afforestation occupies much of the adjacent areas of cutover.  An area of mixed woodland occurs to the north.  A strip of old deciduous woodland occurs along the southwestern boundary.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the true Midland Raised Bog type, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.) and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex</i> <i>panicea</i>).  Other species present include Bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia) and Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>).  In places, on the southern lobe Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) are locally dominant.  The northern lobe is relatively intact, and there are very wet areas between a cluster of Scot’s Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) in the central area and Butlers Lough.  The remainder of the bog supports a well-developed hummock/hollow system.  Drainage has occurred on the southern lobe and there are few hummocks or hollows and Sphagnum growth is poor.   The undrained southern section is slightly quaking and there is good bog moss cover, with <i>Sphagnum magellanicum, S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> forming wet spongy lawns.  A soak with Scot’s Pine and young Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) occurs on this southern lobe.  The vegetation is characteristic of soaks, with lawns of <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>, carpeted with Cranberry and Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>) and locally frequent White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>).  The terrain is wet and quaking.  There is also hummock vegetation covered by the mosses <i>Pleurozium schreberi </i>and<i> Dicranium scoparium</i>, and tall Ling Heather. </p><p style='outline: none;'>Old cutover surrounding much of the dome is dominated by commercial forestry.  Two large reclaimed fields are present on cutover to the north-east.  Some Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) and Downy Birch scrub has encroached upon abandoned cutover towards the centre of the site.   Pockets of birch woodland have developed in places.  Common Reed (Phragmites australis) also occurs on cutover along with some marsh/poor fen vegetation and Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia purpurea</i>), Common Knapweed (<i>Centaurea nigra</i>), Cock’s-foot (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>) and Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>).</p><p>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting along much of the margins of the southern lobe.  Afforestation has occurred on cutaway particularly in the central area.  Areas of old cutaway to the north-east have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning. Fire damage has been recorded in the 1980s and there is evidence of more recent burning on the high bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Monaincha Bog/Ballaghmore Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance, comprising as it does, a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  The site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats including hummock/hollow complexes, and a large soak system (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Moorfield Bog, Co. Galway NPWS Site Code: 001303</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Moorfield Bog NHA is locatated 4 km west of Eyrecourt on the Ballinasloe-Portumna road (R355) in east County Galway.  It can be accessed by a bog track, from the R355, to the north-east of the site.<br /></p><p>The site consists of a raised bog with a single dome of high bog and associated cutover.  The main features of interest are the pools, flushes and wetter areas of the high bog.  Towards the centre of the high bog, there is a good though somewhat limited pool system and a large flush is present in the north of the high bog.  Two smaller flushes occur further south.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog, dominated by Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and Hare’s-tail cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), with the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens </i>and liverwort<i> Pleurozia purpurea</i>.  The high bog is quite wet with a good cover of bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.).  Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) is present and Bog Myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) forms large clumps in places.  The dried out marginal areas have little moss cover and are dominated by Ling Heather.  Towards the centre of the high bog, there is a pool system with some pools containing algae.  However, there are also wet and quaking areas with long tear pools filled with bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>).  Species associated with these pools include White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>), Brown-Beak-sedge (<i>R. fusca</i>), Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>).  The hummock forming bog mosses <i>Sphagnum tenellum, S. capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i> are also present.  The rare bog moss <i>S. pulchrum</i> has been recorded on this raised bog and may still be present in the wetter areas at the centre of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Additional habitat diversity is represented by the flushes, where the following species were recorded: Bog Myrtle, Black Bog-rush (<i>Schoenus nigricans</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>), Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) and Saw Sedge (<i>Cladium mariscus</i>).  The large flush to the north of the high bog is dominated by Purple Moor-grass and some Saw Sedge.  Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) is common here.  A smaller flush occurs to the south of the track with Purple Moor-grass and Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens)</i>.  Another small flush dominated by Common Reed occurs to the south-east with tall Ling Heather, Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorium angustifolium</i>) and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) also present.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is cutover around most of this site with extensive peat-cutting in the west.  Along the eastern margin there has also been some peat-cutting, but this is not as extensive.  To the south there is old cutover dominated by Ling Heather with some Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) and Birch scrub.  To the north and north-west, there are a number of reclaimed fields of wet grassland on cutover.  An area of dry grassland associated with a mineral ridge to the east is also included in the site.  Gorse scrub grows on either side of the bog trackway and Birch scrub occurs on old cutaway to the south.  Some of the ditches on the cutover contain Bulrush (<i>Typha latifola</i>), Pondweeds (<i>Potomogeton</i> spp.) and other aquatic plants, which reveal the groundwater influence in these locations.  Gravel deposits occur in the north-west where they can be seen at the base of the drains, indicating that the peat is shallow in this vicinity.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of agricultural reclamation of old cutover and peat-cutting around the edge of the high bog.  Damaging activities associated with this include drainage and burning, with large portions of the bog being burnt at regular intervals.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  There is a small hill to the north, which is being partially quarried for gravel.  Dumping of household appliances and agricultural waste has also been noted on this site (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Galway 000221</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Moorfield Bog/Farm Cottage NHA is situated approximately 5 km north-east of Ballymee, Co. Roscommon in Co. Roscommon.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site consists of a Western Raised Bog, which has developed between a ridge and a small river.  The bog has good hummock/hollow microtopography, pools, quaking areas, swallow holes a small flush.  The cutover supports humid grassland, a small area of Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) scrub, and forestry.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog.  Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and a range of bog mosses including <i>Sphagnum austinii, S. fuscum </i>and<i> S. cuspidatum</i>.  Western Raised Bog indicator species present include the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>, the mosses <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i> and <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>).  Some Midland Raised Bog indicator species are also found on the bog, including Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The northern half of the bog is wet and spongy with many pools and quaking areas.  The pools are filled with the aquatic bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, and Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>).  There are swallow holes just north of the county boundary and tear pools are situated alongside the cutover which extends into the middle of the bog.  The bog has good hummock/hollow complexes with well-developed hummocks which support <i>Sphagnum austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> Sphagnum fuscum</i>.  The tops of the hummocks support Ling Heather and lichens.  The hollows are filled with bog mosses including <i>Sphagnum magellanicum </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i>, Bog Asphodel and White Beak-sedge.  A small flush dominated by Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>) is found in the middle of the bog near the strip of cutover.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The vegetation of the cutover is dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molina caerulea</i>), with Soft Rush, Devil’s-bit Scabious (<i>Succisa pratensis</i>), Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>), Tormentil (<i>Potentilla erecta</i>), Bent Grass (<i>Agrostis canina</i>) and Hard Fern (<i>Blechnum spicant</i>) also present.  The cutover also supports small patches of Downy Birch scrub and forestry.  Small patches of mineral soil with wet grassland occur to the west and south of the site.</p><p>Active peat-cutting occurs on sections of the north, east, west and south of the high bog margin, and the bog has been almost bisected by peat-cutting activities.  Afforestation on the cutover is located to the west of the site and in a small area of the central cutover.  Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes around the site; the grassland here is used for grazing livestock.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning of the high bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Moorfield Bog/Farm Cottage NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance, comprising as it does, a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  The site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including pools, quaking areas, hummock/hollow complexes, swallow holes and a small flush, as well as a number of scarce plant species (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Longford 001450</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Mount Jessop Bog NHA is situated approximately 5 km south of Longford Town in Co. Longford.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is bordered by a road on its western side and by coniferous forestry on its southern and eastern sides.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Mount Jessop Bog consists of one main lobe of high bog.  Almost 30 % of this is covered by coniferous forestry.  There are wet areas with some spongy patches on the unforested areas, and some areas with pools and hummock/hollow systems.  However, much of the high bog consists of a relatively intact bog moss (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) carpet, with occasional low hummocks.  Tear-pools aligned with the long axis of the bog also occur.  There are large areas of abandoned cutover at the south and west of the site which are colonised by scrub, and active peat-cutting still takes place at the south of the site.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog at Mount Jessop possesses many of the species typical of Midland Raised Bogs in Ireland, such as Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.).  There are areas with hummock/hollow systems and pools.  The pools contain the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i> is found at the pool margins.  The hummocks are mainly composed of bog mosses such as <i>S. capillifolium, S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. fuscum</i>.  Ling Heather is dominant in drier areas near the margins of the high bog.  Pools filled with Bog Asphodel and algal material are found and are possibly tear-pools.  The cutover areas of the site are mainly overgrown with Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) and Willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.) scrub and occasional conifer from failed forestry.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Red Grouse, a bird which is becoming increasingly rare in Ireland, has been recorded at this site, along with the Irish Hare, a Red Data Book species.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting along the southern margin of the high bog, and the drainage associated with this.  A large area at the south of the site was previously planted with coniferous forestry (see below).  Large portions of the bog have been burned in the past and areas of cutover bog have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>Mount Jessop Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work to clear a conifer plantation from the surface of the bog and block ditches has been undertaken by <b>Coillte LIFE</b> (see below).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</b> (LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog and adjoins Lough Ennell to the east.<br /></p><p>This raised bog was originally part of a larger area that has now been mostly cutover and reclaimed for agriculture. Although this bog has no pools there are hummocks throughout the high bog. Cutover is found all around the high bog and there is an area of coniferous forestry on the cutover in the south of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> sp.), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>). The north of the site is wetter than the south, with the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum </i>forming the majority of the hummocks, but there are also occasional <i>S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. fuscum</i> hummocks. The bog moss <i>S. subnitens</i> is also a species of note in the north of the site. Other bog moss species recorded for the site include<i> S. magellanicum</i> and the aquatic bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i>. The hummocks in the north of the site are colonised by Ling Heather, Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>E. angustifoilum</i>), Cranberry, Bog-rosemary, Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), with Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) found in the channels. In the southern half of the site the high bog is dryer and firmer with Ling Heather dominating. Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>) is also recorded on the hummocks in the south of the site with the moss <i>Campylopus introflexus</i> colonising bare peat. On the cutover in the south-west of the site there is an area of Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) woodland with Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus monogyna</i>) and Willow (<i>Salix</i> sp.) occasionally recorded amongst the Downy Birch. In the north-west of the site there has been some regeneration of old cutover with most of the species present on the high bog and good Sphagnum regeneration recorded in this region. In the north-east of the site old cutover is dominated by Ling Heather and Purple Moor-grass, with Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), Bilberry, Gorse (Ulex europaeus) and small areas of Downy Birch also present. On cutover in the south-east of the site there is a dense stand of Cherry Laurel (<i>Prunus laurocerasus</i>) and there is some coniferous forestry on cutover in the very south of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting, forestry, agriculture and shooting. Currently very little active peat-cutting is taking place in the east and south of the site but there are reports of more cutting being planned for the site. There is coniferous forestry on the cutover in the south of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The main area of agricultural land within the site is in the south-east. Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog. There is evidence of clay pigeon shooting on the site and dumping has been reported for this site. All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Raford River Bog, Co. Galway 000321</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Raford River Bog NHA is located approximately 3 km north-west of Bellafa (Ballyfa) in Co. Galway.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is bounded in the north and east by the local road running from Bellafa to Attymon.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This site is the remnant of a much larger bog that is now cutover and reclaimed for agriculture.  The site is split by a mineral ridge, with the majority of the remaining high bog found north of the ridge and a small elongated section to the south.  The larger section of high bog has areas of hummocks and pools towards the centre and the mid-western area is wet and quaking.  The high bog also has a series of mounds present.  There is one flush in the centre of the high bog.  Cutover is found around most of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Western Raised Bog, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>E. vaginatum</i>) and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>).  The bog mosses <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>and<i> S. capillifoliu</i>m are common on the high bog with some <i>S. magellanicum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i> also recorded.  Lichen cover (<i>Cladonia</i> sp.) is reasonably high throughout the site.  The scarce bog moss <i>S. fuscum</i> has also been recorded at the centre of the site. In the mid-western section of the high bog Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) has been recorded growing through carpets of bog moss with the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i>.  In the pools complex in the mid-western area of the bog the pools are colonised by the bog mosses <i>S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>.  These inter-connecting pools also contain Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>); hummocks of the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> occur as islands between the pools.  Tear pools are found throughout the high bog.  Some of these pools are algal while others contain the bog mosses <i>S. cuspidatum </i>and<i> S. auriculatum</i>.  In the eastern margins of the high bog the moss <i>Campylopus atrovirens</i> has been recorded.  There are noticeable mounds on the high bog and tall Ling Heather (up to 1 m) has been noted to be growing on the top of four of these.  There is one large flush at the centre of the site which flows north.  Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) is found on the slopes associated with the flush.  The flush itself consists of a series of swallow holes in an area dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>).  There is a small mineral ridge in the north of the high bog area that is dominated by Hazel (<i>Corylus avellana</i>) and Ash (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>).  The cutover to the east of this ridge is dominated by Purple Moor-grass with Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub seen to the north of this area.  Common reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) has been recorded on the cutover south of the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Greenland White-fronted Goose, a species that is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, and Irish Hare, a Red Data Book species, have been recorded on the site.</p><p>Current landuses on the site include forestry, peat-cutting and agriculture.  The forestry is found on cutover and high bog in the south-west of the site and on cutover in the north of the site.  There is mechanised active peat-cutting taking place around most of the site except in the north and west.  The largest area of mechanised peat cutting is in the south of the site on an area of high bog.  Marginal drains in the east and west of the site are associated with field development.  There are also areas of improved grassland associated with the mineral ridge.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  There is also evidence of old burning in the western part of the high bog.  All of these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Raford River Bog NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance, comprising as it does, a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummocks and pools (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Katharine Duff.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Rinn River, Cos. Leitrim/Longford 000691</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Rinn River NHA is located 4 km east of Roosky in Co. Leitrim. The site comprises of a mosaic of habitats which include a small raised bog, wet woodland and scrub, humid grassland, improved grassland and a lowland river. The site is bounded by improved grassland to the north, west and south and by the Rinn River to the east.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The raised bog on the site consists of a small area of high bog, which has been divided into a north and south section by a large drain. The bog surface is relatively dry. The bog has a distinct dome with a noticeable gradient all around down to the edge of the high bog, so that the area of flat bog on the dome is small. Cutover is found all around the north, west, and south of the site. A semi-natural margin exists along the east side adjacent to the Rinn River. A double drain traverses the site and Downy Birch woodland is beginning to develop on old cutover on the western edge of the bog. Cutover supports wet woodland, scrub and humid grassland.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, mainly dominated by Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) and Hare's-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) with Common Cottongrass (<i>E. angustifolium</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>). The characteristic species, Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) is also present. Bog moss hummocks are poorly developed and there are few pools. The bog moss <i>Sphagnum austinii</i> is present on the site but considered rare.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is no active raised bog recorded on this site. Most of the high bog is somewhat degraded. Sphagnum cover is variable 10–30%, mostly around 15% and comprised mainly the bog moss <i>S. capillifolium</i>. In the wetter softer areas the bog moss <i>S. cuspidatum</i> is found in small hollows, often with <i>Sphagnum tenellum</i>. In the drier areas, Bog Asphodel and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) are common on hollows/flats and Carnation Sedge is also present. Hare's-tail Cottongrass is present throughout while Deergrass is is most abundant on the steeper gradients. The low cover of the lichen <i>Cladonia portentosa</i>, low height of Heather and the stressed appearance of some Sphagnum moss hummocks suggests the site has been subject to recent burning.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There are no obvious signs of cracking or subsidence near the high bog margins. A double drain runs across the northern end of the high bog with a band of Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub and Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) trees occurring along the edge of the drains. A deep perimeter drain surrounds the site to the south, west, and north, with no natural transition to adjoining habitats present.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Along the Rinn River where the wet grassland has not been improved for agriculture the main species present are Creeping Bent (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>), Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>), and Meadowsweet (<i>Filipendula ulmaria</i>) along with Marsh-marigold (Caltha palustris), Common Sedge (<i>Carex nigra</i>), Creeping Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus repens</i>) and other grass species such as Meadow Foxtail (<i>Alopecurus pratensis</i>) and Sweet Vernal-grass (<i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i>). In places the ground is wet enough to support freshwater marsh and it is dominated by tall sedges such as Bottle Sedge (<i>Carex rostrata</i>) with Reed Canary-grass (<i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>). Areas improved for agriculture, by fertilisation, include species such as Yorkshire Fog (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>), Common Sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosa</i>) and Perennial Rye-grass (<i>Lolium perenne</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>The surrounding lowlands in proximity the river are important for a range of waterbird species including the EU Birds Directive Annex I species, Greenland White-fronted Goose and Whooper Swan. Other species using the area include Wigeon, Pochard, Lapwing and Curlew.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is no current landuse on the high bog. Recent peat cutting is confined to few locations on the bog margin. Damaging activities associated with past peat cutting include drainage and burning of the high bog. These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Rinn River NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland. The bog supports typical raised bog vegetation. There is also a semi-natural margin between bog and the Rinn River to the east (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Patrick Crushell.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>River Little Brosna Callows, Co. Offaly 000564</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>River Little Brosna Callows NHA is located 6 km south of Banagher, south of the Little Brosna River in Co. Tipperary. The site comprises a mosaic of habitats which include a small raised bog known as Annagh Bog, cutover bog, wet woodland, humid grassland, improved grassland, and a lowland river. The site is bounded by the Little Brosna River to the north, farmland to the west and local roads to the south and east. The site occurs within the River Little Brosna Callows SPA.&nbsp;</p><p>The raised bog on the site consists of an area of high bog, which has been divided into two sections by a bog track. The bog surface is relatively firm throughout. There is no active raised bog recorded on this site. Old cutover is found all around the site and especially in the east. No recent cutting has occurred around the bog margin. Cutover supports wet woodland, scrub and regenerating bog communities.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog, mainly dominated by Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>).  There is frequent Crossed-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosa</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), the lichen <i>Cladonia portentosa</i> and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>). The bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. tenellum, S. papillosum, </i>and<i> S. magellanicum</i> are present. Sphagnum cover averages 20% but in small areas can reach a cover of 60%. The midland indicator species Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i> are also found on the bog.  There are no pools on the high bog surface. Occasional hummocks of <i>Sphagnum austinii </i>are present, though rare. An inactive Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) flush occurs at the north eastern margin. The old track through the centre of the site is dominated by grassy vegetation with marginal scrub containing Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) and tall Heather.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Cutover areas of the bog support wet regenerating bog communities with Heather, Purple Moor-grass, Crossed-leaved Heath and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> with scattered Downy Birch. Dense stands of Downy Birch woodland with occasional Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) occurs along the north and east margins of the site. Drains in the cutover tend to be infilled and non-functional. Larger drains occur between the cutover and adjacent callow lands which are maintained and functional.</p><p>The main habitat outside of bog and cutover on the site is the extensive area of low-lying callows on the floodplains of the River Little Brosna and River Shannon. These wet meadows are subject to prolonged flooding in winter and early spring. A range of callow pasture is present, with the vegetation influenced by the exact flooding regime and the peat content of the soil.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The main grassland types present are alluvial, sedge-rich, calcareous and improved grasslands. The inundated alluvial grassland is dominated by Floating Sweet-grass (<i>Glyceria fluitans</i>) with other low-growing, wetland grasses such as Creeping Bent (Agrostis stolonifera) and Marsh Foxtail (<i>Alopecurus geniculatus</i>). Wetland herbs such as Water Mint (<i>Mentha aquatica</i>) and Water Forget-me-not (<i>Myosotis scorpioides</i>) are frequent, and the distinction between this grassland and freshwater marsh is indistinct. Sedge-rich grasslands occur on peaty soils, with small sedges such as Yellow Sedge (<i>Carex demissa</i>), Flea Sedge (<i>Carex pulicaris</i>) and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) present. The high base status and the naturalness of this vegetation is indicated by species such as Bog Pimpernel (<i>Anagallis tenella</i>) and Meadow Thistle (<i>Cirsium dissectum</i>). Similar areas that have received more fertiliser are dominated by Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>). Some improved agricultural pasture is included in the site and dry grassland occurs in the well-drained calcareous areas.</p><p>The callow grasslands within the site provide habitat for a range of waterbird species.</p><p>Current landuse on the site includes livestock grazing on the callow lands. There is no peat-cutting on the bog, and cutover areas around the high bog have regenerated secondary wet woodland or bog communities. Damaging activities associated with past cutting include drainage of the high bog and a track which runs through the centre of the bog. These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>River Little Brosna Callows NHA is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  The site supports a good range of bog plant species and raised bog microhabitats, together with low-lying callows on the floodplains of the River Little Brosna. This bog is one of the few remaining raised bogs developed on the former floodplain of the River Shannon and its tributaries. The wet meadows surrounding the bog are subject to prolonged flooding in winter and early spring. The occurrence of the site within the River Little Brosna Callows SPA (NPWS Site Code: 004086), which is an internationally important site for wintering waterfowl, adds to the interest of the site (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

                                        "description": "<p style='outline: none;'><i>View of the callows along the River Suck NHA, which includes a number of raised bog area south of Ballyforan. Photo: Google Street View.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>River Suck Callows, Cos. Galway/Roscommon NPWS Site Code: 000222</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>The Suck River Callows is a long sinuous area of semi-natural lowland wet grassland, which floods extensively each winter along the River Suck between Castlecoote in the north and Shannonbridge in the south, passing through Ballinasloe.  The Suck River forms the Roscommon - Galway county boundary and joins the River Shannon at Shannonbridge.  Along most of its borders, former raised bogs (now in the process of large-scale harvesting by Bord na Móna) are present.  Just south of Ballyforan, there is a small intact raised bog on the eastern bank of the river, which contains both high bog and cutover.  This is situated in Co. Roscommon and can be accessed from a road to the east.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>The main habitat of the Suck River Callows is flood meadows of wet grassland and the associated aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats of drainage ditches.  Secondary habitats of importance, which directly border the callows within the site are species-rich dry and wet calcareous grassland, flooded fen, wet woodland and a small raised bog with a tear pool system.  There is a semi-natural margin between this raised bog and the river.  Improved grasslands are also included within the site at the upper margin of wet grasslands.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The wet grassland vegetation consists of Common Sedge (<i>Carex nigra</i>), Creeping Bent (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>), Brown Sedge (<i>Carex disticha</i>), Marsh Foxtail (<i>Alopecurus geniculatus</i>), Reed Canary-grass (<i>Phalaris arundicacea</i>), Creeping Buttercup (Ranunculus repens), Jointed Rush (<i>Juncus articulatus</i>), Common Spike-rush (<i>Eleocharis palustris</i>) and Floating Sweet-grass (<i>Glyceria fluitans</i>).  Many of these species are important food plants for the wintering wildfowl which also forage on the improved grasslands within the site.  A large area of flooded fen with Black Bog-rush (<i>Schoenus nigricans</i>) and Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) occurs to the north of Derrycahill Bridge.  Small patches of Common Club-rush (<i>Scirpus lacustris</i>) occur in shallows along the river margin.</p><p style='outline: none;'>At Ballyforan the small intact raised bog has been classified as a True Midland Raised Bog.  The vegetation of the high bog has been affected by burning and is dominated by Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), however, there is active Bog Moss (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) regeneration occurring.  Species occurring on the site include <i>Sphagnum fuscum, S. austinii&nbsp;</i>and<i> S. capillifolium, S. cuspidatum</i> (in elongated tear pools), Great Sundew (<i>Drosera anglica</i>), Brown Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>) and Lesser Bladderwort (Utricularia minor).  Cross-leaved Heath (Erica tetralix), Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.) and lichens (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) occur in the unburnt areas.  The bog appears to be drying out and the western margin has been invaded by Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>At Ballyforan Bog, the cutover to the south of the high bog is primarily reclaimed grassland.  There is an uninterrupted transition from this high bog to low-lying callow grassland to the west. Active peat-cutting occurs to the north-west and east with some scrub encroachment on old cutover.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There are also small areas of cutover at the margins of the developed (cut-away) raised bogs on the banks of the River Suck.  Some of this cutover is very wet, bordering on to floodmeadows and contains permanent pools with Lesser Bladderwort.  Royal Fern (<i>Osmunda regalis</i>), cottongrasses and orchids (<i>Dactylorhiza</i> spp.) have been recorded on these cutover areas.  Regenerating birch and Alder (<i>Alnus glutinosa</i>) woods occurs on old cutover margins throughout the site.  These wet woodlands have an understory of Ling Heather and Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>The Suck River Callows is an important site for wintering waterfowl.   Of particular note is the internationally important flock of Greenland White-fronted Geese based along the Suck.   The birds congregate mainly in the middle reaches of the river.  A separate sub-flock is centred at Glenamaddy Turlough SAC.  The average maximum winter count for the period 1988/89 to 1993/94 was 386.   In recent years, the only complete count of waterfowl for the site was in January 2002.  Three species had populations of national importance: Whooper Swan, Wigeon&nbsp; and Lapwing.  Other species which were present included Mute Swan, Teal, Pintail and Curlew.  Of the species which occur regularly at this site, Greenland White-fronted Geese and Whooper Swan are listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive.  A further Annex I species, Golden Plover, occurs at times.  The good quality riverine and grassland habitats are also home to populations of Otter and Irish Hare, and Brown Trout occur in the river.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include, agriculture, active peat-cutting, forestry and conservation.  The wet grasslands of the callows are used for agriculture.  At Ballyforan Bog, active peat-cutting is most prevalent to the north-west and along the eastern margin of the high bog.  The cutover to the south has been reclaimed for agriculture.  There are extensive areas of peat-cutting by Bord na Móna along the boundaries of the site and a large area of callow and esker has been recently planted with forestry.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include habitat loss and drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  These activities have all resulted in the loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the raised bog, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.  There is a no-shooting area at Muckanagh, north of Ballyforan.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The Suck River Callows NHA, along with the River Shannon Callows cSAC (000216) and River Little Brosna Callows NHA (000564), form by far the largest area of lowland wet grassland in Ireland and Britain. These callows are each designated as a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive for the presence of Internationally and Nationally Important numbers of wintering waterfowl (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Screggan Bog, Co. Offaly, NPWS Site Code:  000921</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Screggan Bog is situated approximately 7km south-west of Tullamore in County Offaly.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The Clodiagh River flows at the east of the site, and Pallas Lough bounds the site at the west, while the other margins are bounded by areas of cutover, woodland and grassland.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Screggan Bog consists of three main sections divided by roads and tracks.  There are areas with occasional small pools, and some poorly developed hummock/hollow systems in the largest section.  Much of the bog is quite dry due to drainage and peat-cutting at the margin.  An unusual feature is the extensive colonisation of its south-east portion by Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>).  There are large areas of coniferous forestry on the cutover areas of the site, along with areas of deciduous woodland and scrub.  </p><p style='outline: none;'>The high bog at Screggan shows features typical of a Midland Raised Bog.  The bog surface is soft and wet in places, and is largely comprised of bog mosses (<i>Sphagnum</i> spp.) including two notable hummock-forming species <i>S. austinii and S. fuscum.  S. papillosum, S. capillifolium, S. tenellum, S. auriculatum </i>and<i> S. cuspidatum</i> are also found.  The hummocks are colonised by Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Hare’s-tail Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>) and Bog-rosemary <i>(Andromeda polifolia</i>).  In the wet channels between hummocks Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) are common.  Around the margin of the high bog a range of habitats which have developed on the cutover areas.  Frequently, the flat cutover surface is covered by Ling Heather and Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>).  In some places it has been colonised by Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), Scot’s Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) and Rowan (<i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>).  The understorey often contains Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus monogyna</i>), Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>) and Bramble (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i> agg.), amongst others.  There are areas of grassland with species such as Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>), Nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>), Creeping Buttercup (<i>Ranunculus repens</i>) and Meadowsweet (<i>Filipendula ulmaria</i>).  </p><p style='outline: none;'>At the western end of the site there is a flooded area with species-rich marsh vegetation.  Plants recorded here include rushes (<i>Juncus</i> spp.), Bogbean (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>), Marsh Marigold (<i>Caltha palustris</i>), Wild Angelica (<i>Angelica sylvestris</i>), and Water Mint (<i>Mentha aquatica</i>).  There are also some plants here which are indicative of fen conditions, namely Great Fen-sedge (<i>Cladium mariscus</i>) and Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>).  At the eastern edge of the site there are areas of woodland, the easternmost being a satellite of the main Screggan Bog site.  These woodlands consist of commercial conifer plantations surrounded by an area of scrub woodland containing several plant species of high scientific interest, notably two Red Data Book species, Alder Buckthorn (<i>Frangula alnus</i>) and Bird Cherry (<i>Prunus padus</i>). There is also an excellent diversity of other native trees and shrubs occurring including Pedunculate Oak (<i>Quercus robur</i>), Irish Whitebeam (<i>Sorbus hibernica</i>), willows (<i>Salix</i> spp.), Yew (<i>Taxus baccata</i>), Alder (<i>Alnus glutinosa</i>), Blackthorn (<i>Prunus spinosa</i>), Hazel (<i>Corylus avellana</i>) and Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>). </p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of peat-cutting around much of the eastern edge of the high bog, and the drainage associated with this.  Large portions of the bog have been severely burnt in the past.  Significant areas of cutover bog have been drained, cleared and reclaimed for agricultural purposes.  There are also considerable amounts of coniferous forestry on the cutover at the north-east of the site.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: Peter Foss.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Slieve Bog, Co. Galway, NPWS Site Code:  000247</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Slieve Bog is situated about 5 km east of Dunmore in Co. Galway.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The south and east margins of the site are bounded by the Yellow River, the northern and western sections by roads.<br /></p><p>The site consists of one dome of sloping bog associated with subsidence caused by drainage.  Intact dome peat is restricted to the south-east.  Tear pools are found to the west of the site.  There are two extensive flush systems within the extensive drainage system found on the bog.  Cutover bog occurs all around the margins of the high bog except where the bog slopes down to the river where the edge is semi-natural.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of the Western Raised Bog type, consisting of Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum</i> spp.), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), Common Lousewort (<i>Pedicularis sylvatica</i>) and the bryophytes <i>Campylopus atrovirens, Racomitrium lanuginosum </i>and<i> Pleurozia purpurea</i>.  The intact dome in the south-east is uniformly wet and contains the relic of a good hummock/hollow system.  Small hummocks of bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium, S. subnitens</i> and the rare <i>S. pulchrum</i> are found here.  Hollows are poorly vegetated with a lot of bare peat.  <i>Sphagnum papilliosum, S. cuspidatum, S. pulchrum</i> and the liverwort <i>Odontoschisma sphagni</i> occur in small depressions but not in pools.  A long sinuous flush dominated by Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>), Ling Heather and Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) flows out towards the north-east margin.  The other flush consists of a series of swallow holes which support a vegetation of tall Ling Heather, Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus monogyna</i>) and Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>).  Active cutover is mainly bare peat with Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and Soft Rush (<i>Juncus effusus</i>); old cutover is dominated by Purple Moor-grass and Ling Heather.  Some drains filled with the bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>also occur.</p><p>Red Grouse, a species that is becoming increasingly rare in Ireland, has been recorded on this bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site consists of active peat-cutting, with mechanised peat extraction occurring on 60% of the site’s perimeter.  This has resulted in extensive drainage, with 60% of the bog (north-west section) becoming severely damaged by deep drainage on the dome.  In addition, there has been fire damage to undrained areas in the recent past and bog mosses have been slow to recover on the site.  Erosion of the peat occurs along the north-west perimeter.  The south-east intact area shows signs of a lowering water table (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is bounded in the south by the local road between Breedoge and Ballybaun cross roads.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>This site is the remnant of a larger bog that has now been cutover and reclaimed for agriculture.  The site was formerly linked with Bella Bridge Bog NHA (591) and Cornaveagh Bog NHA (603) but both are now separated by approximately 1 km of cutover.  Mineral ridges are found in the west and north-east of the site and mineral ridges border most of the site.  There are small hummocks on the bog and only tear pools are present.  A small flush has been recorded in the east of the site.  Cutover is found mostly in the south and north-west of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This is a North-Western Raised Bog, but due to extensive fire damage when it was last surveyed the bog did not have the vegetation typical of this type of raised bog.  However, it is hoped that the bog has recovered from the fire damage in recent years.  Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>) are very common on the high bog.  Of the hummock-forming bog mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>and<i> S. papillosum</i> have been recorded on the site, as have the more scarce <i>S. austinii and S. fuscum</i>.  Only tear pools are still present on the bog but the aquatic bog moss <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i> has been recorded on the site.  A small flush occurs on the eastern edge of the bog and the bog moss <i>S. recurvum</i> is found here.  Three sections of old cutover in the west, south and south-east support areas of scrub woodland.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuses on the site include peat-cutting and agriculture.  Mechanised peat-cutting is taking place mostly in the north-west and south-east of the site.  Areas of cutover all around the site have been reclaimed for agriculture.  Most of the fields within the site that contain improved grassland are on mineral soil.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage throughout the site and burning of the high bog.  There has been extensive burning on the site in the 1980s and 1990s that has damaged the bog.  All these activities have resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Photo: George Smith.</i></p><p style='outline: none;'><u>Wooddown Bog, Co. Westmeath 000694</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Wooddown Bog NHA is situated approximately 4km east of Mullingar in Co. Westmeath.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The site consists of a Midlands Raised Bog type, which has developed in a basin.  The bog has good hummock/hollow microtopography but few pools. There is a small soak area situated close to the northern edge of the high bog.  This area also supports a low canopy of Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) woodland.  A small fen is located to the south-west of the bog.  The cutover supports humid grassland, Birch and Gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) scrub and woodland.  There appears to be a flush on the cutover off the northern margin of the high bog.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Much of the high bog has vegetation typical of a Midland Raised Bog.  Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus cespitosus</i>) and the bog moss <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> are the dominant species on the bog.  Other common species include Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and Common Cottongrass (<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>).  Midland Raised Bog indicators include Bog-rosemary (<i>Andromeda polifolia</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>) and bog moss <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>.</p><p style='outline: none;'>There are only a few pools on the bog, which is very dry.  These pools support the bog moss S<i>phagnum cuspidatum</i>, Common Cottongrass and White Beaked-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>).  There is good hummock/hollow microtopography where burning has not occurred.  The hummocks comprise bog mosses, including <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i>, Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>), Ling Heather and Cladonia Lichens</p><p style='outline: none;'>There is a flush and soak system on the northern margin of the highbog, which supports Downy Birch woodland with an understorey of Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>).   Bog Mrytle (<i>Myrica gale</i>), Meadowsweet (<i>Filipendula ulmaria</i>), the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum palustre, S. recurvum var tenue</i> and the rare <i>Sphagnum fimbriatum</i> are also found in the flush.</p><p style='outline: none;'>To the south is an area of fen, which supports Long-stalked Yellow Sedge (<i>Carex lepidocarpa</i>), Common Sedge (<i>C. nigra</i>), Bottle Sedge (<i>C. rostrata</i>), Water Mint (<i>Mentha aquatica</i>) and Marsh Cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla palustris</i>).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Birch and mixed woodland occur on the north and north-east margin of the high bog on the cutover.  The Birch woodland to the north of the site has Ling Heather, Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>) and the bog mosses <i>Sphagnum palustre </i>and<i> S. capillifolium</i>.  The woodland to the north-east also supports Sycamore (<i>Acer pseudoplantus</i>), Elder (<i>Sambucus nigra</i>) and Bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>).</p><p>The cutover, which contains areas of old peat cutting and active peat cutting, also supports Birch and Gorse scrub, flush vegetation, humid grasslands and forestry.  Grassland is present on mineral soil to the west of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Current landuse on the site includes active peat-cutting in the north-east and south-east of the site.  Afforestation occurred on the high bog and cutover to the east and on cutover to the south-east but has been clear felled (see below).  Areas of cutover have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes around the site.  The grassland is used for grazing.  Damaging activities associated with these landuses include drainage and burning of the high bog.  These are all activities that have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Wooddown Bog NHA is a site of conservation significance comprising as it does a raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  This site supports a good diversity of raised bog microhabitats, including hummock/hollow complexes, a soak system and flushes, as well as a number of scarce plant species (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work to clear a conifer plantation from the surface of the bog and block ditches has been undertaken by <b>Coillte LIFE </b>(see below) at the eastern end of the site.<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Restoration work on this bog was undertaken as part of <b>Coillte’s LIFE funded Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</b> (LIFE09 NAT/IE/000222) undertaken at 17 bogs around Ireland between 2011-2014 funded through the EU Life-Nature Programme (Further information: <a href='http://www.raisedbogrestoration.ie' target='_blank'>Demonstrating Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland</a>).<br /></p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

Galway, NPWS Site Code:  000267</u></p><p style='outline: none;'>Funshin Bog is located 9 km east of Glenamaddy in County Galway.  The site comprises a raised bog that includes both areas of high bog and cutover bog.  The site is bounded in the south-west by a local road.<br /></p><p>There are areas of well developed hummocks that are most prominent on the eastern side of the bog.  There is one area of flush in the south-west of the site.  Cutover is found all around the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>This bog has been classified as a Western Raised Bog with Ling Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), Carnation Sedge (<i>Carex panicea</i>), cottongrasses (<i>Eriophorum</i> sp.), Deergrass (<i>Scirpus</i> <i>cespitosus</i>), Cross-leaved Heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>) and the moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i>.  Bog mosses recorded on the site include the hummock forming <i>Sphagnum fuscum </i>and<i> S. austinii</i>.  The bog moss <i>S. magellanicum</i> has also been recorded.  Although the bog has well formed hummocks there are no pools and the only hollows are algal and of poor quality.  Where the site has not been burnt for a long time, such as the northern region, the lichens <i>Cladonia portentosa </i>and<i> C. uncialis</i> are common.  The moss <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> is also common on top of hummocks in areas of the bog that have not been burnt.  On the western side of the bog, where the effects of burning have been most severe Deergrass, Cross-leaved Heath and Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) were recorded with patchy carpets of regenerating bog mosses.  There is a Purple Moor-grass (<i>Molinia caerulea</i>) dominated flush in the south-west of the site with Heath Milkwort (<i>Polygala serpyllifolia</i>), Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>), Bog-myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>) and some willows (<i>Salix</i> sp.).  A small area of wet Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) woodland is present on the cutover in the north-east of the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>The rare bird species Red Grouse has been recorded at the site.</p><p style='outline: none;'>Except at the western edges of the site there is active peat-cutting carried out all around the high bog.  Mechanical peat-cutting is most noticeable in the north, south-west and west of the site.  Damaging activities associated with this landuse include drainage throughout the site and extensive burning of the high bog.  The western side of the bog has also been recently damaged by burning.  These activities have all resulted in the loss of habitat, damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",

In addition, Bog Asphodel (<i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>) and White Beak-sedge (<i>Rhynchospora alba</i>) are commonly found.  There is quite high lichen (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) cover in parts of the high bog, and there are a number of young Downy Birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>) plants scattered over the surface of the high bog.</p><p>The Irish Hare, a Red Data Book species, has been recorded at the site.</p><p>Current landuse on the site consists of intensive peat-cutting around the edge of the high bog, and the drainage associated with this.  There are large areas of coniferous forestry all around the margins of the site.  These areas have also been significantly drained.  Large portions of the bog have been burned in the past.  These activities have resulted in loss of habitat and damage to the hydrological status of the site, and pose a continuing threat to its viability (Source: NPWS).&nbsp;</p><p style='outline: none;'>Further site information available from the <a href='http://www.npws.ie' target='_blank'>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a>.</p>",
